A new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated with a mixture of the herbal root extract of ashwagandha and three minerals\\xa0viz. zinc chloride, magnesium gluconate, and sodium selenate. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of Biofield Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) on the formulation when applied to splenocyte cells isolated from mice spleen. The formulation was divided into two parts; one was the control without any Biofield Energy Treatment, while the other part was defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely by seven renowned Biofield Energy Healers. The test formulation was evaluated to find the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-1β along with non-cytotoxic concentrations by MTT assay. The splenocytes were given the Biofield Energy Treated and untreated sample at concentrations range (0.00001053 to 10.53 µg/mL) for 48 hours and was reported with safe concentration up to 1.053 µg/mL with percentage viability range from 76.7% to 109.2% in both samples. Biofield Energy Healing significantly enhanced the cell viability as compared with the untreated formulation. The expression of TNF-α was significantly inhibited in the Biofield Treated formulation at 0.01053, 0.1053, and 1.053 µg/mL by 1.77%, 1.93%, and 3.55%, respectively compared with the untreated formulation. The rest of the tested concentrations of the Biofield Treated formulation showed an increase in TNF-α expression at 0.00001053, 0.0001053, and 0.001053 µg/mL by 7.26%, 8.50%, and 8.50%, respectively compared to the vehicle control group. Similarly, the MIP-1α expression was inhibited by the Biofield Energy Treated formulation and showed immunosuppression activity at 0.01053 µg/mL by 18.47% (p≤0.001) compared to the untreated formulation. MIP-1α expression was reported as 628.94 ± 13.0 pg/mL in the untreated formulation, while it decreased to 512.74 ± 1.9 pg/mL in the Biofield Treated formulation at 0.01053 µg/mL. In addition, the IL-1β secretion was also significantly inhibited by the Biofield Treated formulation at concentrations 0.001053, 0.01053, 0.1053, and 1.053 µg/mL by 72.02%, 50.16%, 30.68%, and 22.11%, respectively as compared with the untreated formulation. Overall, The Trivedi Effect®\\xa0significantly down-regulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentiated the immunosuppressive effect of the treated formulation, which can be better utilized in organ transplants, anti-aging, stress management, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory disorders, etc. to modulate the immune system by improving overall health.', 'title': 'Evaluation of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines Expression in Mouse Splenocytes After Incubation with Biofield Treated Herbomineral Formulation: Effect of Biofield Energy Healing Treatment -  Trivedi Effect®'}, {'tag': ['Biofield', 'Biofield Energy', 'Biofield Energy Treatment', 'Biofield Treatment', 'Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy', 'FT-IR Spectroscopy', 'Indole', 'Indole-3-Carbinol', 'Intermediate For Synthesis Of Pharmaceutical Compounds', 'Mahendra Trivedi', 'Synthesis Of Sumatriptan', 'TGA thermogram', 'Thermal Analysis', 'The Trivedi Effect', 'Trivedi Effect', 'Tryptophan', 'Uv-Vis Spectroscopy', 'X-Ray Diffraction'], 'description': 'Indole compounds are important class of therapeutic molecules, which have excellent pharmaceutical applications. The objective of present research was to investigate the influence of biofield treatment on physical and thermal properties of indole. The study was performed in two groups (control and treated). The control group remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treated group. The control and treated samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. XRD study demonstrated the increase in crystalline nature of treated indole as compared to control. Additionally, the treated indole showed increase in crystallite size by 2.53% as compared to control. DSC analysis of treated indole (54.45ºC) showed no significant change in melting temperature (Tm) in comparison with control sample (54.76ºC). A significant increase in latent heat of fusion (ΔH) by 30.86% was observed in treated indole with respect to control. Derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) of treated indole showed elevation in maximum thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) 166.49ºC as compared to control (163.37ºC). This was due to increase in thermal stability of indole after biofield treatment. FT-IR analysis of treated indole showed increase in frequency of N-H stretching vibrational peak by 6 cm-1 as compared to control sample. UV spectroscopy analysis showed no alteration in absorption wavelength (λmax) of treated indole with respect to control. The present study showed that biofield has substantially affected the physical and thermal nature of indole.', 'title': 'Biofield Treatment: A Potential Strategy for Modification of Physical and Thermal Properties of Indole'}, {'tag': [], 'description': 'In order to encourage communication scientists to consider using physiological measures, this Etmaal 2017 preconference will focus on the opportunities and pitfalls of using such measures in communication research.

This novel portrays two schools of ineffectual native educators who seem to be antagonists: the traditional old school and the new modern intellectuals. Postcolonial/race theories of Fanon, Appiah, Du Bois, and Woodson as well as Gramsci’s notion of the “organic intellectual” are employed to get a clearer image of the role of intellectuals and politicians in shaping the future of a country in the post-independence era. The article concludes that intellectuals with European education may contribute to the corruption of their country due to reasons like divided loyalties, miseducation, and lack of communication with the public. Additionally, Achebe is critical of the current politicians and the excluded public. So, our analysis employs Woodson’s concept of “the miseducation of the Negro” because such “miseducation” produces incompetent politicians like Chief Nanga, weak intellectuals like Odili Samalu, and ignorant people like the public in the novel. Real hope against governmental corruption in Achebe\\'s satirical novel can be found in integrating the class of intellectual/political leaders and the public and in a different kind of indoctrination, neither colonial nor neo-colonial. The truly educated class and the “organic intellectuals” produced from the public are key solutions for a better \"Nigeria.\" Hence, this article highlights the role of politicized education in post-independence nation building and tackles the mishaps of nascent nationalism.', 'title': 'Intellectuals, Politicians, and the Public in Chinua Achebe’s A Man of the People: A Postcolonial Critique'}, {'tag': [], 'description': 'Participants will first answer questions about themselves, their current romantic partner, and their relationship.

Two sets of ATCC samples were taken in this experiment and denoted as A and B. Sample A was revived and divided into two parts Group (Gr.I) (control) and Gr.II (revived); likewise, sample B was labeled as Gr.III (lyophilized). Gr.

Yet, conditionality may result in vulnerable groups disproportionately experiencing disentitlement from benefits, one of the rights of social citizenship, because they are, in some cases, less able to meet these conditions. Rising sanctions, then, may be the product of a disconnection between welfare conditionality and the capabilities of vulnerable claimants. To test this hypothesis, we evaluate whether sanctions are higher in areas where there are more vulnerable Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants, namely, lone parents, ethnic minorities, and those with disabilities. We find that sanction rates are higher in local authorities where more claimants are lone parents or live with a disability, and that this relationship strengthened since welfare reforms under the Conservative-led coalition.

The reasons for this increase are not well understood, nor are what factors might protect people’s access to food. Here we test the hypothesis that an emerging gap between food prices and wages can explain increases in reported inability to afford protein-rich foods and whether welfare regimes can mitigate its impact. We collected data on 21 countries from 2004-2012 on food prices and deprivation related to food, denoted by reported in ability to afford to eat meat, chicken, fish or a vegetarian equivalent, every second day, from EuroStat 2015 edition and on wages from the OECD 2015 edition. After adjusting for macroeconomic factors, we found that each 1% rise in the price of food over and above wages was associated with greater self-reported food deprivation (β = 0.063, 95% CI: 0.033 to 0.092); particularly among impoverished groups. But, this association also varied across welfare regimes. In Eastern European welfare regimes, a 1% rise in the price of food over wages was associated with a 0.081 percentage point rise in food deprivation (95% CI: 0.051 to 0.11) while in Social Democratic welfare regimes we find no clear association (p = 0.37). Rising prices of food coupled with stagnating wages are a major factor driving food deprivation, especially in deprived groups; however, our evidence indicates that more generous welfare systems can mitigate this impact.', 'title': 'The growing disconnect between food prices and wages in Europe: cross-national analysis of food deprivation and welfare regimes in 21 EU countries, 2004-2012'}, {'tag': [], 'description': 'Decision-making and learning involve habitual (model-free) and goal-directed (model-based) processes.

This study investigated this relation between one’s empathic response tendencies (perspective-taking, empathic concern, fantasy, and personal distress; Davis, 1980) and the accuracy with which s/he makes judgments of others. Using four different samples (N = 1153), the tendency to perspective-take (ds = .23 – .27) and show empathic concern (ds = .28 – .42) were all positively related meta-analytically to distinctive accuracy, normative accuracy, and the assumed similarity of trait judgments. However, the empathic tendencies for fantasy and personal distress showed more complex patterns of relation. These findings are discussed in relation to previous literature, and in particular why it is reasonable for empathy to be related to the accuracy of trait judgments.\\n', 'title': 'Seeing and Feeling Your Way to Accurate Personality Judgments: The Moderating Role of Perceiver Empathic Tendencies'}, {'tag': ['activism', 'climate movement', 'protest', 'social movements'], 'description': 'How do social movements broaden their societal reach and mobilize more participants?  To date, research has focused on social networks, organizational coalitions, and computer-mediated communication to aid in mobilization, but most research assesses these mechanisms in relative isolation. This paper integrates these perspectives to explore the ways social movements expand their ranks through large-scale street demonstrations and marches.  Analyzing data collected through random surveys of participants at two of the largest demonstrations in the history of the climate movement—the Copenhagen Climate March in 2009 and the People’s Climate March in 2014—we assess how the movement expanded.  Consistent with the literature on protest mobilization, we show that the climate movement increased participation at these events via personal networks, organizational coalitions, and computer-mediated channels of communication. In addition, we find clear evidence that large-scale protest events like the People’s Climate March are bringing new people, including passive members of social movement organizations and disengaged sympathizers, to the streets and into the movement.  The paper concludes by discussing the implications of our findings on social movement expansion through large-scale demonstrations and outlining opportunities for future study.', 'title': 'Onto the Street and Into the Movement:  Understanding how Social Movements Expand their Reach through Large-Scale Protest Events'}, {'tag': [], 'description': 'According to Self-Maintenance theory, people notice their dishonest acts, and thus experience ethical dissonance between heir misconduct and their positive moral self. In this view, dishonesty is facilitated by justifications that redefine moral boundaries. By contrast, the Bounded Ethicality approach suggests that biased perception prevents people from becoming aware of their dishonesty. We tested the key process assumptions behind these accounts using pupillary responses and fixation data and found physiological evidence for both kinds of mechanisms. Specifically, physiological arousal increased in cheating responses, but was attenuated by the level of ethical dissonance, suggesting that people are somewhat aware of their wrongdoings. At the same time, we found attentional biases that reduced the likelihood for detecting potentially disadvantageous information. We conclude that dishonest acts come at the internal cost of increased tension, which people aim to avoid by preemptive biased processing as well as post-hoc justifications. \\n\\n***http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.1932/abstract***', 'title': '\"I can see it in your eyes\": Biased processing and increased arousal in dishonest responses'}, {'tag': ['Bayes Factors', 'Bayesian Mixed Models', 'Individual Differences', 'Order Constraints', 'Priming'], 'description': \"Model comparison in Bayesian mixed models is becoming popular in psychological science. Here we develop a set of nested models that account for order restrictions across individuals in psychological tasks. An order-restricted model addresses the question 'Does Everybody', as in, 'Does everybody show the usual Stroop effect', or ‘Does everybody respond more quickly to intense noises than subtle ones.’ The crux of the modeling is the instantiation of 10s or 100s of order restrictions simultaneously, one for each participant. To our knowledge, the problem is intractable in frequentist contexts but relatively straightforward in Bayesian ones. We develop a Bayes factor model-comparison strategy using Zellner and colleagues’ default g-priors appropriate for assessing whether effects obey equality and order restrictions. We apply the methodology to seven data sets from Stroop, Simon, and Eriksen interference tasks. Not too surprisingly, we find that everybody Stroops—that is, for all people congruent colors are truly named more quickly than incongruent ones. But, perhaps surprisingly, we find these order constraints are violated for some people in the Simon task, that is, for these people spatially incongruent responses occur truly more quickly than congruent ones!

There have been especially high increases in mortality rates within the elderly, a group which we choose to focus our analyses on. In England and Wales, we estimate that there were 39,074 more deaths in the year to July 2015 as compared to the year to July 2014 (32,208 of these additional deaths were of individuals aged 80+). Exploring changes in mortality rates by 5 year age band and sex, we demonstrate that these increases have been felt everywhere geographically; in poor and affluent areas, in rural and urban areas. We explore some possible explanations for the increases and find that few individual factors on their own appear able to explain the patterns we observe. The implications of our findings are profound given what has come before them, combined with the current political climate of austerity.

The powder samples of both compounds were equally divided into two parts, referred as control and treated. The treated part of both compounds was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. After that, both control and treated samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The XRD data revealed that the biofield energy treatment has increased the lattice parameter of unit cell by 3.35% in the treated CaC2 sample as compared to the control. The density of treated CaC2 sample was reduced upto 4.49% and molecular weight was increased upto 4.70% as compared to the control. The crystallite size of CaC2 was reduced from 98.19 nm (control) to 52.93 nm in the treated CaC2 sample as compared to the control. The FT-IR analysis exhibited that the absorption band attributed to C=C stretching vibration was shifted to higher wavenumber as compared to the control. Thus, above data suggested that biofield energy treatment has considerable impact on the physical and structural properties of CaC2. Besides, in Pr6O11, the XRD did not show any significant change in lattice parameter, density and molecular weight. However, the FT-IR spectra revealed that the absorption band attributing to Pr-O stretching vibration was shifted from 593 cm-1 (control) to higher wavenumber 598 cm-1 in the treated Pr6O11 sample.

The paper investigates whether group order in supposedly neutral conflict titles (e.g., Polish-Russian War) is systematically biased towards naming the in-group first (e.g., Polish-Russian War in Polish; Russian-Polish War in Russian) and whether group order affects perceptions of the groups involved. Based on linguistic evidence that individuals have the tendency to name themselves first, we expected and found a systematic tendency to name the in-group first in N = 172 real-world titles of historical conflicts from more than forty languages (Study 1), under controlled conditions with participants from different cultures (Studies 2a and 2b), and in a minimal group experiment (Study 3), which identifies group membership as a crucial factor and rules out alternative explanations. Furthermore, based on findings on perception, it is predicted and found in three studies (Study 4, 5a  and 5b) that a group is perceived as more important when mentioned first rather than second. This effect depended, however, on group order in the questions asked. Additionally, the first group was consistently associated with more power. Combined, seemingly neutral conflict titles may therefore increase ethnocentrism as it is the in-group that is mostly mentioned first and because of that perceived as more important.

The surface area of treated Ba2CaWO6 was increased by 9.68% as compared to the control sample. The FT-IR spectroscopic analysis exhibited that the absorbance band corresponding to stretching vibration of W-O bond was shifted to higher wavenumber from 665 cm-1 (control) to 673 cm-1 after biofield energy treatment. The ESR spectra showed that the signal width and height were decreased by 88.9 and 90.7% in treated Ba2CaWO6 sample as compared to the control. Therefore, above result revealed that biofield energy treatment has a significant impact on the physical and structural properties of Ba2CaWO6.', 'title': 'Evaluation of Physical and Structural Properties of Biofield Energy Treated Barium Calcium Tungsten Oxide'}, {'tag': [], 'description': 'we are conducting a meta analysis on the associations between the dimensions of emerging adulthood (IDEA) and substance use', 'title': 'IDEA AND SUBSTANCE USE: A META ANALYSIS'}, {'tag': ['#computational', '#Dutch', '#fMRI', '#Language', '#languagemodel', '#lexicon', '#modeling', '#naturalisticstimulus', '#perplexity', '#phonotactics', '#POS', '#syntax'], 'description': 'Data for:  Alessandro Lopopolo,\\nStefan L.

What I endeavour to demonstrate is Hans Jonas’ specific and original contribution to present day widely debated issues related to utopia, such as human dignity, the vulnerability of life, and human enhancement. I believe that Jonas fully develops the interdisciplinary relevance of utopia by investigating the very relationship between imagination and experience, as originally suggested by Thomas More. Jonas’ efforts aim at tackling difficulties and threats related to contemporary political and technological utopias. Moreover, Jonas’ reflections on the vulnerable sacredness of the “image of man” are the core of his innovative “utopia” and are relevant to present day controversial ethical and bioethical issues related to technology, such as the ecological crisis, genetic manipulation, and human enhancement. As a result, utopia can be understood as the fil rouge of his thinking. In more detail, my research foresees the following phases: 1) A preliminary enquiry into Jonas’ “philosophical biology” and in particular into his anthropology in order to understand the role played by imagination, image, and utopia; 2) The second phase focuses on the notion of “dystopia” in Jonas’ ethical thinking; 3) In the third phase I shall focus on Jonas’ criticism of anthropological, political, and technological utopias. I shall focus on the criticism that Jonas levels against aspects of the modern utopia and on the complex relationship between Jonas and Ernst Bloch; 4) In the last phase I shall consider the fourth viz. metaphysical meaning of utopia proposed by Jonas.

A new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated with a mixture of the herbal root extract of ashwagandha and three minerals\\xa0viz. zinc chloride, magnesium gluconate, and sodium selenate. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of Biofield Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) on the formulation when applied to splenocyte cells isolated from mice spleen. The formulation was divided into two parts; one was the control without any Biofield Energy Treatment, while the other part was defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely by seven renowned Biofield Energy Healers. The test formulation was evaluated to find the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-1β along with non-cytotoxic concentrations by MTT assay. The splenocytes were given the Biofield Energy Treated and untreated sample at concentrations range (0.00001053 to 10.53 µg/mL) for 48 hours and was reported with safe concentration up to 1.053 µg/mL with percentage viability range from 76.7% to 109.2% in both samples. Biofield Energy Healing significantly enhanced the cell viability as compared with the untreated formulation. The expression of TNF-α was significantly inhibited in the Biofield Treated formulation at 0.01053, 0.1053, and 1.053 µg/mL by 1.77%, 1.93%, and 3.55%, respectively compared with the untreated formulation. The rest of the tested concentrations of the Biofield Treated formulation showed an increase in TNF-α expression at 0.00001053, 0.0001053, and 0.001053 µg/mL by 7.26%, 8.50%, and 8.50%, respectively compared to the vehicle control group. Similarly, the MIP-1α expression was inhibited by the Biofield Energy Treated formulation and showed immunosuppression activity at 0.01053 µg/mL by 18.47% (p≤0.001) compared to the untreated formulation. MIP-1α expression was reported as 628.94 ± 13.0 pg/mL in the untreated formulation, while it decreased to 512.74 ± 1.9 pg/mL in the Biofield Treated formulation at 0.01053 µg/mL. In addition, the IL-1β secretion was also significantly inhibited by the Biofield Treated formulation at concentrations 0.001053, 0.01053, 0.1053, and 1.053 µg/mL by 72.02%, 50.16%, 30.68%, and 22.11%, respectively as compared with the untreated formulation. Overall, The Trivedi Effect®\\xa0significantly down-regulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentiated the immunosuppressive effect of the treated formulation, which can be better utilized in organ transplants, anti-aging, stress management, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory disorders, etc. to modulate the immune system by improving overall health.\\n', 'title': 'Evaluation of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines Expression in Mouse Splenocytes After Incubation with Biofield Treated Herbomineral Formulation: Effect of Biofield Energy Healing Treatment - Trivedi Effect®'}, {'tag': ['archaeological theory', 'archaeology', 'science', 'social science'], 'description': 'This is an \"debates\" essay that critiques the common archaeological construct that our scholarship is divided between the humanities and the natural sciences.

Technical education in India contributes a major share to the overall education system and plays a vital role in the social and economic development of the nation. There is a rapid growth of technical education in last decade in terms of the no. of institutes and intake capacity in India, however, institutes failed to attract enrollments which observed noticeable gap in between the actual no. of enrollments and intake capacity. In the year 2015-16, 46% of seats were vacant in Technical Education in India. The purpose of this paper is to highlight holistic marketing approach with promotion mix on diversified enrollments to motivate enrollments in selecting institute of Technical education. Design methodology: A qualitative research by a survey (through a structured questionnaire) of students who are presently enrolled (Current-students) and those who have completed their study (Post-students) belonging to the institutes offering Technical Education situated in Khandesh region of India and affiliated to the North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon. Findings: The study found that diversified characteristics of enrollments are related with the promotion mix of TE institute in selection of technical educational institute. This study investigates the usefulness of school visits, institution publications, websites, campus visits, word-of-mouth (friends, alumni, school teachers), advertisements (radio, television, magazines) and events on campus, as a tool of holistic marketing and promotion mix. Social Networking and Institute’s Website are the emerging tools of promotion mix in selection TE institute in Khandesh Region. Research limitations: The survey is delimited to the enrollments of technical education belonging to North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon and located in Khandesh region of India. Practical implications: This article provides relationship of promotion mix &amp; diversified characteristics of enrollments on institutional choices. Different communication strategies of promotion mix can be used based on diversified characteristics (segmentation) of enrollments to attract enrollments.

Control and treated samples were studied for the determination of cancer biomarkers such as multifunctional cytokines viz. interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), prostate specific antigen (PSA), and free prostate specific antigen (FPSA) concentrations using ELISA assay on day 10. Experimental results showed a significant reduction of IL-6 level in endometrium (12%) and prostate (98.8%) cancer cell lines while a significant increase was observed in TNF-α level in endometrium (385%) and prostate (89.8%) cancer cell lines as compared to control. No alteration of PSA level was observed in biofield treated endometrium and prostate cell line. Similarly, no alterations were evident in IL-2R and FPSA levels in endometrium and prostate cell lines after biofield treatment as compared to control.

Notwithstanding the potential for generating temporary and independent spaces for transferring and fostering digital competences and increasing citizens’ participation in the SC, we argue that LL largely foster a form of participation framed within a model of civic stewardship for ‘smart citizens’. While presented as horizontal, open, and participative, LL and civic hacking are often rooted in pragmatic and paternalistic discourses and practices related to the production of a creative economy and a specific version of SC. As such, by encouraging a particular kind of re-use of vacant space, LL potentially contributes to gentrification pressures within locales by attracting the creative classes and new investment.

Previous statistical frameworks for analyzing fit hypotheses emphasized the necessity of commensurable scales, which means that both predictors must be measured on the same content dimension and on the same numerical scale. In some research areas, however, it is impossible to achieve scale equivalence, because the predictors have to be measured with different methods, such as explicit attitudes (e.g., questionnaires) and implicit attitudes (e.g., reaction time task). In this paper, I differentiate numerical congruence from fit patterns, a concept that does not depend on the notion of commensurability, and hence can be applied to fit hypotheses with incommensurable scales. Polynomial regression can be used to test for the presence of a fit pattern in empirical data. I propose several new regression models for testing fit patterns which are statistically simpler and conceptually more meaningful than a full polynomial model. An R package is introduced which provides user-friendly functions for the computation, visualization, and model comparison of several fit patterns.

It was collected and organized according to the errors committed. Errors taxonomy adapted from James’ (1998) and Al-Shormani and Al-Sohbani’s (2012) was used in identifying and analyzing these errors. Semantic errors were classified into five categories namely formal mis-selection, formal mis-formation, lexical choice, collocation and lexico-grammatical choice. The semantic errors identified were 346. These errors were classified into four categories namely, formal misformation (46.7%), distortion due to spelling (32.4%), lexical choice (40.6%) and lexicogrammatical choice (2.4%). The results show that direct translation from the first language (L1), assumed synonym and misselection of letters sub-categories score the highest number of the errors, i.e.14.2%, 13.08% and 12.08% respectively. While the sub-category, both collocations incorrect error was the lowest (0.52%). The other errors take the form of paraphrase (11.5%) and Idiomacity (8.5%).

This diffuse social movement had its heyday in the late 1970s and early 1980s when there were 30,000 squatters and still exists today despite squatting in residential buildings being criminalised in 2012. Analysis is based on a database of 245 social centres, which are examined in terms of duration, time period, type of building and location.

The aim is to study the impact of biofield energy treatment on selected farms for cashew farming. The control and biofield treated farms were divided as control and treated farms, and Mr. Trivedi provided the biofield energy treatment to the treated farms. Further, the plants and fruits were analyzed for overall growth of plants, chlorophyll content, productivity, pathological study, and shelf life using UN specifications for International Trade, biophoton emission study, and DNA fingerprinting using RAPD method. No chemicals, fertilizers, were used on the treated plot, although regular practices were followed on control farms such as fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides due to the high incidence of disease and the requirement of nutritional supplements in the region. The analysis showed that biofield treated farm plants have thicker and stronger branches with more secondary and tertiary branches, flowering pattern, and canopy of plants was improved than trees of the same variety along with height of the plants, as compared with the control. The results showed that chlorophyll a and b content in biofield treated lands plants were increased by approximately 30% and 93% respectively, while total chlorophyll content by 45% as compared with the control. The pathological examination showed the presence of fungi namely Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Botryodiplodia theobromae in control, which were absent in treated plants. Biophoton study suggested that the cashew fruits were bigger in size with high density, strength, and vitality as compared with the control. The shelf life analysis reflected that the biofield treated cashews showed sweet taste, and can be stored for longer duration due to less moisture, and altered minerals content, such as high iodine, and low p-anisidine level.

According to Lakens, Schneider, Jostmann, and Schubert (2011), classification performance is affected by physical distance between response keys – indicating a cognitive tendency to represent categories in spatial code. However, previous evidence for a key distance effect (KDE) from a color-naming Stroop task is inconclusive as to whether: (a) key separation automatically leads to an internal spatial representation of non-spatial stimulus characteristics in participants, or if the KDE rather depends on physical spatial characteristics of the stimulus configuration; (b) the KDE attenuates the Stroop interference effect. We therefore first adopted the original Stroop task in Experiment 1, confirming that wider key distance facilitated responses, but did not modulate the Stroop effect as was previously found. In Experiments 2 and 3 we controlled potential mediator variables in the original design. When we did not display instructions about stimulus-response mappings, thereby removing the unintended spatial context from the Stroop stimuli, no KDE emerged. Presenting the instructions at a central position in Experiment 4 confirmed that key separation alone is not sufficient for a KDE, but correspondence between spatial configurations of stimuli and responses is also necessary. Evidence indicates that the KDE on Stroop performance is due to known mechanisms of stimulus-response compatibility and response discriminability. The KDE does, however, not demonstrate a general disposition to represent any stimulus in spatial code.\\n\\nPublished: March 18, 2014\\nJonas, M., Eloka, O., Stephan, J., &amp; Franz, V. H. (2014).

However, the action capabilities of other people might moderate this spatial dependency of the motor compatibility effect.

Conditions of the take-over situation were manipulated by adding a verbal non-driving task (20 questions task) and by variation of traffic density. Two age groups consisting of 36 younger and 36 older drivers drove either with or without a non-driving task on a six-lane highway. They encountered three situations with either no, medium or high traffic density where they had to regain vehicle control and evade an obstacle on the road. Older drivers reacted as fast as younger drivers, however, they differed in their modus operandi as they braked more often and more strongly and maintained a higher time-to-collision (TTC). Deterioration of take-over time and quality caused by increased traffic density and engagement in a non-driving task was on the same level for both age groups. Independent of the traffic density, there was a learning effect for both younger and older drivers in a way that the take-over time decreased, minimum TTC increased and maximum lateral acceleration decreased between the first and the last situation of the experiment. Results highlight that older drivers are able to solve critical traffic events as well as younger drivers, yet their modus operandi differs.

X-ray diffraction study asserted that the biofield treatment did affect the crystalline nature of cellulose. The percentage of crystallite size was found increased significantly in treated cellulose by 159.83%, as compared to control sample. This showed that biofield treatment was changing the crystalline nature of treated cellulose.
