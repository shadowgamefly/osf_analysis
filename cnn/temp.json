    "description": "the use of herbomineral formulations in the healthcare sector has increased due to their high safety and better therapeutic action a new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated with a mixture of the herbal root extract of ashwagandha and three minerals viz zinc chloride , magnesium gluconate , and sodium selenate the aim of the study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of biofield energy healing \\( the trivedi effect \\) on the formulation when applied to splenocyte cells isolated from mice spleen the formulation was divided into two parts one was the control without any biofield energy treatment , while the other part was defined as the biofield energy treated sample , which received biofield energy healing treatment remotely by seven renowned biofield energy healers the test formulation was evaluated to find the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as tnf , mip 1 , and il 1 along with non cytotoxic concentrations by mtt assay the splenocytes were given the biofield energy treated and untreated sample at concentrations range \\( 0 00001053 to 10 53 g ml \\) for 48 hours and was reported with safe concentration up to 1 053 g ml with percentage viability range from 76 7 to 109 2 in both samples biofield energy healing significantly enhanced the cell viability as compared with the untreated formulation the expression of tnf was significantly inhibited in the biofield treated formulation at 0 01053 , 0 1053 , and 1 053 g ml by 1 77 , 1 93 , and 3 55 , respectively compared with the untreated formulation the rest of the tested concentrations of the biofield treated formulation showed an increase in tnf expression at 0 00001053 , 0 0001053 , and 0 001053 g ml by 7 26 , 8 50 , and 8 50 , respectively compared to the vehicle control group similarly , the mip 1 expression was inhibited by the biofield energy treated formulation and showed immunosuppression activity at 0 01053 g ml by 18 47 \\( p 0 001 \\) compared to the untreated formulation mip 1 expression was reported as 628 94 13 0 pg ml in the untreated formulation , while it decreased to 512 74 1 9 pg ml in the biofield treated formulation at 0 01053 g ml in addition , the il 1 secretion was also significantly inhibited by the biofield treated formulation at concentrations 0 001053 , 0 01053 , 0 1053 , and 1 053 g ml by 72 02 , 50 16 , 30 68 , and 22 11 , respectively as compared with the untreated formulation overall , the trivedi effect significantly down regulated the pro inflammatory cytokines and potentiated the immunosuppressive effect of the treated formulation , which can be better utilized in organ transplants , anti aging , stress management , autoimmune disorders , and inflammatory disorders , etc to modulate the immune system by improving overall health",

    "description": "with the increasing popularity of herbomineral preparations in healthcare , a new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated with ashwagandha root extract and minerals viz zinc , magnesium , and selenium the aim of the study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of biofield energy healing \\( the trivedi effect \\) on the herbomineral test formulation using mice splenocytes the test formulation was divided into two parts one part was the control without the biofield treatment the other part was labelled the biofield treated sample , which received the biofield energy healing treatment remotely from twenty renowned biofield energy healers the splenocyte cells were exposed with the test formulation at ranges of 0 00001053 to 10 53 g ml for cell viability by mtt assay , with cell viability ranging from 77 50 to 176 52 tnf was significantly inhibited by 15 88 , 15 28 , 12 30 , 12 60 , and 22 72 at 0 00001053 , 0 001053 , 0 1053 , 1 053 , and 10 53 g ml , respectively in the biofield treated test formulation compared to the vehicle control \\( vc \\) tnf was significantly reduced by 2 33 and 8 35 at 1 053 and 10 53 g ml , respectively compared to the untreated test formulation il 1 was significantly reduced by 30 81 , 27 36 , 23 92 , 18 40 , 11 27 , and 21 16 at 0 00001053 , 0 0001053 , 0 001053 , 0 01053 , 0 1053 , and 1 053 g ml , respectively in the biofield treated test formulation compared to the vc il 1 was significantly reduced by 48 63 \\( p 0 001 \\) and 15 28 at 0 00001053 and 0 0001053 g ml , respectively in the biofield treated test formulation compared to the untreated test formulation mip 1 expression was inhibited by the biofield treated test formulation and showed immunosuppressive activity at 0 01053 , 0 1053 , 1 053 , and 10 53 g ml by 22 33 , 16 25 , 15 58 , and 21 83 , respectively compared to the vc the biofield treated test formulation significantly reduced the mip 1 expression by 13 27 and 15 67 \\( p lt 0 05 \\) at 0 01053 and 10 53 g ml , respectively compared to the untreated test formulation the results showed the expression of ifn was significantly reduced by 33 45 , 25 38 , 37 15 , 27 74 , 32 44 , 23 03 , and 44 21 at 0 00001053 , 0 0001053 , 0 001053 , 0 01053 , 0 1053 , 1 053 , and 10 53 g ml , respectively in the biofield treated test formulation compared to the vc further , the ifn level was significantly decreased by 19 02 at 10 53 g ml in the biofield treated test formulation compared to the untreated test formulation overall , the results demonstrate that the trivedi effect biofield energy healing \\( tebeh \\) significantly enhanced the anti inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the treated formulation , and may also be useful in organ transplants , anti aging , and stress management by improving overall health and quality of life",
