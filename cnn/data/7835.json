{"abstract": "In 1902 Lenin published the political tract which became a basic text for left-wing activists titled 'What is to be Done?'. Della Elliott tended not to ask that question; rather she saw what had to be done, and got in and did it. In the process, her doing was careful, meticulous, and professional; all the metaphorical'i's were dotted, and the 't's crossed. Moving away from metaphors to actualities, spelling had to be correct, and meanings clear.", "title": "Obituary: Kondelea (Della) Elliott (1917-2011)", "subject": "law"}
