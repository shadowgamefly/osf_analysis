{"abstract": "The business side of medicine is driven by profits and changes have been implemented to achieve this goal with the utilization of such things as electronic medical records, e-prescriptions, the increased use of generic drugs and the reduction in the number of diagnostic imaging and blood tests ordered. A less well known change is teleradiology, the ability of health care providers to transmit radiological images, like X-rays, CT Scans and MRIs, from one location to another for diagnostic or consulting purposes. The premise is that a radiologist can diagnose images remotely from anywhere in the world as long as there is a phone or internet connection. This allows a medical facility, regardless of its size, to have a radiologist on call at any hour to quickly review their diagnostic studies without having to employ such a specialist on premises.  The business advantages of teleradiology are obvious, but who is responsible when something goes wrong?  After all, teleradiology services are usually set up as independent contractors but can the healthcare provider escape liability for the malpractice of a radiologist who is not an employee of the hospital or urgent care center?  The complex and sometimes far removed relationships teleradiology creates can make ascertaining who is liable and how to seek legal redress uncertain.  This article will address the myriad legal issues that arise with the use of this technology in the practice of medicine.", "title": "TELERADIOLOGY:  THE PERKS, PITFALLS AND PATIENTS", "subject": "law"}
