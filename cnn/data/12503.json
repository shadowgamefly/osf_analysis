{"abstract": "State of the Urban Youth India 2012: Employment, Livelihoods, Skills Executive Summary Every third person in urban India is a youth. In less than a decade from now, India, with a median age of 29 years will be the youngest nation in the world. Indias demographic transformation is creating an opportunity for the demographic burden of the past to be converted to a dividend for the future. For this to happen the country needs to adopt a three-pronged policy that will address the issues of employment, livelihoods and the skill status of youth. The State of the Urban Youth India 2012: Employment, Livelihoods, Skills developed and produced by IRIS Knowledge Foundation, Mumbai on a commission from the UN-HABITAT Global Urban Youth Research Network of which it is part, is a first attempt to pull together a data and knowledge base on and of youth in urban India. With a number of commissioned chapters from a well-known scholars, the focus of the Report is youth employment and livelihoods in urban India. Through a three-city survey the Report incorporates a youth perspective on the situation of urban youth that is revealed by data and literature. It does not aspire to make recommendations, but only to suggest broadly the need for a paradigm shift in addressing the issue of the urban young.", "title": "State of the Urban Youth, India 2012", "subject": "law"}
