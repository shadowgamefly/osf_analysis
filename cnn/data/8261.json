{"abstract": "This paper examines the use of private conciliation to resolve discrimination disputes in Hong Kong under the auspices of the Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). The unique nature of discrimination disputes are analyzed, along with various policy issues arising out of the use of a private informal process of conciliation by the EOC to enforce and ensure compliance with public anti-discrimination legislation. A range of public policy issues are discussed with proposals made for potential reform of the EOC conciliation model for dispute resolution.", "title": "Private Conciliation of Discrimination Disputes: Confidentiality, Informalism and Power", "subject": "law"}
