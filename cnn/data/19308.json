{"abstract": "This article charts the conflicted, dissonant policies of the European Union towards intellectual property and climate change. It contends that there is a mismatch between the empirical work of the European Patent Office and the quietist policy options contemplated by the European Union. This article contends that the European Union needs to develop a Clean Technology Directive to allow for a differentiated approach to patent law and clean technologies  especially given the past complicity of the European Union in global warming and climate change. It highlights essential elements in a comprehensive policy package for the reform of patent law  considering patentable subject matter; patent incentives; and patent exceptions.", "title": "A Proposal for a Clean Technology Directive: European Patent Law and Climate Change", "subject": "law"}
