{"abstract": "In 2011, Justice Kennedys plurality opinion in J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro repeatedly cited International Shoe v. Washington, a 1945 decision that transformed the law of personal jurisdiction. Kennedy believed that International Shoe broadly supported his position that a state may hear a suit arising from a within-state workplace injury to its citizen only if the foreign (out-of-state) corporate defendant specifically markets its products to that state.\n\nThis article reexamines the jurisprudence of International Shoes author, Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, to argue that Kennedy hijacked International Shoes half-buried legacy of judicial restraint. Scholars have suggested that Stone hoped that International Shoe would allow federal judges virtually unlimited discretion to decide personal jurisdiction cases. But Stone believed that the reasonableness and minimum contacts standard that he introduced in International Shoe reduced the discretion of federal judges by signaling that they should defer, even if they disagreed, with any well-justified exertion of state authority. And Stone specifically concluded in the 1930s that plaintiffs preferred forum reasonably applied its own law to suits arising from within-forum workplace injuriesparticularly when plaintiff lived in the forumregardless of the foreign corporate defendants choice of law. In other words, shortly before International Shoe, Stone essentially rejected Kennedys position in Nicastro.", "title": "The Battle for the Soul of International Shoe", "subject": "law"}
