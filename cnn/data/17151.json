{"abstract": "This article argues that our times, characterized as they are by dreams of vast wealth, environmental destruction, and growing social inequality, resemble nothing so much as earlier get-rich-quick periods like the Gilded Age and the California gold rush.\nI put forward a number of parallels between those earlier periods and now and suggest that the current fever is likely to end soon.  This will come as a relief to those of you who, like me, deplore the regressive social policies, bellicose foreign relations, and coarsening of public taste that we have been living througheven if some of our more libertarian friends found the times invigorating.", "title": "You Are Living in a Gold Rush", "subject": "law"}
