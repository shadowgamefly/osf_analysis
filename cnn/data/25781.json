{"abstract": "Recently we are witness to a growing interest in nuptial agreements, both in Jewish and civil law. In civil law it is customary to trace the meta-story of the development of civil family law from sacrament to status and from status to contract. Indeed, during the last fifty years we have seen how nuptial agreements developed to regulate different aspects of marriage in civil law, both in Israel and in the rest of the world. During the last twenty-five years an interest has also emerged in halakhic perspectives on freedom of contract, which is available for couples who wish to marry according to Jewish law. Thus, the couple can make conditions which will regulate economic relations during their marriage and in the event of the breakdown of the family through divorce or through the death of one of the spouses. These halakhic agreements are generally referred to as prenuptial agreements. These agreements are intended mainly to reduce the number of cases where the husband refuses to give his wife a get (religious divorce) by imposing monetary fines on a recalcitrant husband (or wife), to ensure that the partner opposed to a divorce will not be able to prevent the other partner from going through with the divorce.", "title": "'Freedom of Contract' in Halachic Family Law?
