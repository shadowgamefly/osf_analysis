{"abstract": "When lawyers write about the past they venture upon the territory of historians and encounter new methodological concerns. Both look to the past with the tools of their trade but the former, it is said, use the lens of the present and the latter the lens of the past.   In the context of constitutional interpretation the term law-office history has highlighted the instrumental nature of legal sensibility but historians have never denied either the historical significance of legal doctrine or the potential of historical study to illuminate current legal problems. If, as this paper considers, the idea of the past necessarily begins with a conception of the present the question evaporates and the juxtaposition becomes a matter of emphasis rather than opposition.  As historian Jack Rakove has suggested [s]kepticism about the limits of judicial reasoning does not require a blanket dismissal of the possibility that historically grounded approaches . . . might indeed yield fruitful results.     Using narratives constructed from the chambers papers of federal district judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr., who actively supervised the desegregation of the Boston MA public school system from 1974 until 1985, this paper explores an aspect of recent U.S. history with both the lens of the present and the lens of the past. It argues that, in terms of agency, a narrative of the relationship between the judge and his expert advisors illuminates the practical difficulties of implementing a major piece of social change. However the perspective of current debates concerning the appearance of judicial neutrality in both the United States and the United Kingdom now grounds a narrative of norm and change in which the respective priorities to be accorded to process and outcomes have yet to be determined", "title": "Desegregation in Boston: The Lens of the Present and the Lens of the Past", "subject": "law"}
