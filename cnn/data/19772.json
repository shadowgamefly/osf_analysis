{"abstract": "This article serves to accomplish three things.  First, to provide students with feedback tools that will help them achieve academic success and improve the quality of their law school experience.   Students who do not receive feedback or receive inadequate feedback should use the provided forms to proactively and creatively find ways to obtain feedback.  They should never be afraid or too proud to ask others for assistance with generating this feedback.\nSecond, to encourage professors and Academic Support professionals who believe students should receive adequate feedback to take steps towards providing the feedback.\nThird, to provide Academic Support professionals with forms to help them monitor student exam writing progress and organize this information.  The documents also allow the professionals to have in-depth one-on-one meetings and to provide more student-specific suggestions and assignments.", "title": "MIND THE GAP:  HOW LAW PROFESSORS, ACADEMIC SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS, AND STUDENTS CAN FILL IN THE FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT GAP", "subject": "law"}
