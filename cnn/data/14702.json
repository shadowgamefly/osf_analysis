It then will discuss specific examples from revised Article 3 to illustrate how the revision affects present Article 3 and how it furthers the goals of the NCCUSL and the ALI. It will also include references to present North Carolina case law or statutory law that may be affected by the revision. If this preview conveys to the BAR at least a taste of what the revision of Article 3 is about, the purpose of this article will be fulfilled.", "title": "A North Carolina Preview of the Revised (1990) Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code", "subject": "law"}
