{"abstract": "The 2011-2014 Frame Agreements are recasting the Italian Industrial Relations System. This essay argues that there are good reasons to believe that very soon Italian collective bargaining schemes will be at the most difficult crossroads. The choice for unions and works councils (RSU) will be based on the decentralized concession bargaining and bargaining on retrenchment measures. The unions will revitalize their membership base on strategies that will include new forms of union recognition systems (law and/or voluntarism).", "title": "Dissenso collettivo e razionalit individuali nelle relazioni industriali italiane.
