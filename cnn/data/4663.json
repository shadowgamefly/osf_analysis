{"abstract": "The failure to link the Ninth Amendment and Privileges or Immunities Clause for the purpose of creating unenumerated fundamental rights has been a persistent but rarely discussed aspect of the Courts jurisprudence. That should change. There need not be an ongoing tension between the Courts counter-majoritarian role and the authority of states to govern through the democratic process. If the Constitutions text gives the Court a solid foundation upon which to recognize new rights and thereby create a more just society, then the exercise of that power is fundamentally democratic. The Ninth Amendment and Privileges or Immunities Clause provides that path and, ironically, results in a process of decision-making that is fairer than the Courts current due process jurisprudence.", "title": "Fundamental Unenumerated Rights Under the Ninth Amendment and Privileges or Immunities Clause", "subject": "law"}
