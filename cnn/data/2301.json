{"abstract": "When the superstar athlete -Iron Mike Webster - a 9-time National Football League (NFL) Pro Bowler, 4-time Super Bowl Champion, Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers died at age 50 with severe brain dysfunction after becoming homeless and living in a truck, it was discovered he had a previously nameless disease, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). The discovery of CTE opened the floodgates on interest in delayed manifestation brain diseases caused by repeated blows to the head. As part of that flood, numerous class actions were brought by retired NFL football players against the NFL for their alleged brain diseases caused by the repeated blows to the head they received while playing in the NFL. That litigation recently settled with the NFLs liability totaling approximately $1 billion, and now the battle over who will pay that $1 billion liability is being fought between the NFL and more than 30 of the NFLs insurers in a New York state court (the NFL v. Insurance Industry litigation). This article is the first scholarly effort to analyze the NFL v. Insurance Industry litigation. In doing so, it provides a battlefield map regarding the principal legal issues that will govern the outcome of the NFL v. Insurance Industry litigation: 1) choice of law, 2) trigger, 3) allocation, 4) number of occurrences, and 5) the expected or intended exclusion. The article then compares and contrasts the law on these issues for New York, the state in which the NFL v. Insurance Industry is being litigated, and Pennsylvania, the state in which the underlying NFL players class actions were adjudicated, and predicts potential outcomes under each states laws.", "title": "A Battlefield Map for NFL v.
