{"abstract": "A recurring and delicate issue in the GATT/WTO dispute settlement processes is whether, and to what extent, WTO Panels and the Appellate Body (AB) should defer to national government decisions. With regard to disputes under the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement), WTO Panels adopted, and the AB endorsed, a standard of review close to de novo review. As a result, the WTO jurisprudence in SPS disputes has been subject to sharp criticisms over the years. In the recent EC-Hormones II case, the AB has deviated from its established case law and articulated a new standard of review. I argue that the deviation indicates that the AB is now willing to endorse a more deferential, procedurally focused standard of review, as opposed to the conventional substantive, merit-based review, in SPS disputes where human health and safety are at stake. The new standard of review in EC-Hormones II is of fundamental importance in discussing a central issue of the GATT/WTO regime, i.e., to what extent WTO rules should penetrate into its Members domestic regulatory order.", "title": "Standard of Review under the SPS Agreement after EC-Hormones II", "subject": "law"}
