{"abstract": "Disputes arise in business. Approximately 65,000 businesses, including 35-53% of small businesses managers, are involved in a lawsuit in federal court each year. Even when business managers are represented by experienced attorneys, successful managers cannot and should not entirely delegate the final decision to resolve a dispute through trial or through settlement to their attorneys. It is a managerial responsibility to communicate effectively with attorneys to settle disputes quickly and cheaply. Being prepared to settle early can avert a more expensive settlement later and/or a significant and costly loss at trial. As one executive said after a $7.2 billion loss, The case should have been and could have been settled. In fact, 95% of cases settle. The decision to refuse a settlement offer and proceed to trial is the final decision of the business manager, not the attorney. It is a decision fraught with error. This article suggests that undergraduate business schools can do more to prepare future managers for the responsibility of managing a dispute through to settlement by having students participate in mock trials and jury deliberations. As law students, future attorneys learn to manage and settle cases in clinical programs. As undergraduate business majors take legal environment of business courses, their understanding of the importance of settlement to resolve disputes can be improved through experiential learning. Both the research on undergraduate business students and practicing attorneys indicates that behavioral law and economics has important implications for managers and attorneys in resolving disputes.", "title": "Reaching Settlement", "subject": "law"}
