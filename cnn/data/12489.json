The saga of Modern WoEr Trading Company Ltd. v The Ministry of Finance of the Peoples Republic of China raises compelling questions about the relationship of Chinas 1999 Tender and Bidding Law and Chinas 2002 Government Procurement Law, the nature of administrative power in China, and the ability of Chinese public procurement law to offer justice to aggrieved suppliers", "title": "Waiting for Leviathan: A Note on", "subject": "law"}
