{"abstract": "In the years since September 11, 2001 U.S. personnel have been implicated in many incidents involving possible war crimes as defined by the Geneva Conventions.  The author critically examines the current U.S approach to handling war crimes and concludes that the process is fundamentally flawed and has repeatedly produced unjust outcomes, particularly in a series of high profile cases that have greatly damaged the position of the U.S. in the international community.  The author concludes that not only has the U.S. lost the respect of the international community, but has also simultaneously increased the likelihood that U.S. personnel who serve in conflicts in the future will be subjected to severe mistreatment at the hands of our enemies.  In reaching this conclusion the article analyzes the implications of high-profile cases of like Haditha, the Stryker Brigade Kill Team, and Pantano before comprehensively assessing the likely reasons for such repeated U.S. failures.  Finally, the author urges the President to redouble the efforts of the Departments of Defense and Justice in investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed by U.S. personnel, and calls for the creation of a joint Department of Defense and Department of Justice War Crimes Review Commission to prospectively and retrospectively address war crimes cases.", "title": "Overcoming the Unfortunate Legacy of Haditha, the Stryker Brigade Kill Team, and Pantano:  Establishing More Effective War Crimes Accountability by the United States", "subject": "law"}
