{"abstract": "This article addresses the recent kidnapping and disappearance of forty-three college students from Iguala, Mexico (the Iguala Mass Kidnapping), under the lens of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (the Convention).  While Mexicos reporting documents on its compliance with the Convention paint a positive picture of how that country is adhering to Convention, any notion that the country was in compliance with the Convention was completely shattered through the Iguala Mass Kidnapping.  The article concludes that the actions of state officials during the Iguala Mass Kidnapping violated articles one, six, and twenty-three of the Convention, and sets forth three steps that Mexicos government can take in the present moment to indicate its willingness to meet to its obligations under the Convention: 1) prosecute state officials involved in the Iguala Mass Kidnapping under Mexicos Federal Criminal Code, 2) change state and federal legislative definitions of enforced disappearance to align with the definition in the Convention, and 3) implement a national training program for all government officials to prevent future enforced disappearances.", "title": "Ya me canse: How the Iguala Mass Kidnapping Demonstrates Mexicos Continued Failure to Adhere to its International Human Rights Obligations", "subject": "law"}
