{"abstract": "A treatment of the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and of movement and the rights to peaceful assembly and association cannot be exhaustive without a thorough insight into the right of organized labour to picket or mount pressure with a view to currying favours. This is because all over the world, the right of labour to picket vis--vis the need to maintain peace, law and order has been a contentious constitutional issue. This paper examines the right of workers to embark on strike and the place of law in regulating issues of strike. It takes the view that there is good authority to argue that both legal as well as so called illegal strikes appear to be accommodated in the law. It further canvasses that any labour laws made to impede the workers right to strike will amount to infringement of the constitutional rights of workers and is capable of undermining the growth of trade unionism and industrial harmony.", "title": "The Extent of the Right to Strike in Nigerian Labour Law", "subject": "law"}
