{"abstract": "When Apology is Not Enough: Irelands Ryan Commission\nOne manifestation of the growth of the reparations movement has been the demand that historical institutional child abuse be addressed. In Ireland, the most glaring manifestation of this abuse occurred in the industrial schools, orphanages and reformatories, which were Statesponsored, but managed by the religious congregations of the Catholic Church. Thousands of children were committed to these institutions, from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries, on grounds ranging from poverty or illegitimacy to petty criminality. The physical, emotional and sexual ill-treatment they suffered left a profound, but largely hidden, legacy in Irish society. It began to be highlighted by survivors and the media in the 1990s and the Government responded with a wide-ranging and unique package of measures which included apology, redress, acknowledgment and public inquiry. The Commission of Inquiry (CICA or Ryan Commission) was established in 2000 and reported in 2009.\nThe Irish experience carried many hallmarks of the truth commission and the lessons gleaned from the Ryan Commission will have application in other such contexts. This article combines empirical research on the creation and operation of the Commission with a theoretical analysis of the strengths and weakness of its ethos, procedure and outcome. The Commission exemplifies: feasible justice: (the compromises necessary in such an undertaking); the Inquiry as a theatre of power and, lastly, the possible over-valuing of the factual or historical account, at the expense of the therapeutic experience.\nDr Carol Brennan School of Law University of Buckingham Buckingham, MK18  1EG UK\n+44 (0)1280 814080 carol.brennan@buckingham.ac.uk", "title": "When Apology is Not Enough: Ireland's Ryan Commission", "subject": "law"}
