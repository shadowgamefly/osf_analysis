{"abstract": "A  review of the Dodd-Frank rulemaking projects suggests that the U.S. has  entered into a race to the top of over-the-counter derivative  regulation. Many of the Dodd-Frank statutes and proposed rules go well  beyond the relatively modest objectives agreed to by the G20 countries  in 2009. These efforts in the U.S. create a legal environment ripe for  regulatory arbitrage and the isolation of U.S. OTC derivative markets.  Isolation results from participants simply abandoning U.S. markets  because of overly aggressive U.S. regulation. Regulatory arbitrage  occurs as both U.S. and non-U.S. persons attempt to structure their  trading activities to avoid the extraterritorial reach of Dodd-Frank.  This paper will discuss the regulatory arbitrage implications triggered  by the Dodd-Frank reforms and concerns surrounding the extraterritorial  powers given to the CFTC to enforce these mandates.", "title": "Regulatory Arbitrage, Extraterritorial Jurisdiction and Dodd-Frank: The Implications of US Global OTC Derivative Regulation", "subject": "law"}
