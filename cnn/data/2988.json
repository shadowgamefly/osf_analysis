{"abstract": "\"This anthology contains 12 papers that explain and critique Canada's Badgley and Fraser Reports, which present research findings and recommendations pertaining to the definition and regulation of sexual behavior and sexual imagery in Canadian society.\n\nThe opening paper reviews the Federal Government's formal reaction to the reports it commissioned, including an overview of the reports and a summary and evaluation of existing sexual-offense legislation. A paper by a member of the Badgley Committee discusses major criticisms of the report, and a paper by a member of the Fraser Committee describes the philosophy and procedures of the committee. Critiques of the reports include a response by the Canadian Psychological Association, an analysis of the Badgley Committee's efforts to address child sexual abuse, and a discussion of the Badgley Committee's failure to address flaws in the socialization of male sexual behavior in Canadian society. This same theme is pursued in other papers that criticize the Badgley Committee for not recommending ways to dismantle the Canadian patriarchal social structure that fosters male abuse of females. Critiques of the Fraser Report focus on its censorship and pornography recommendations along with both committees' recommendations on juvenile prostitution.\"--NCJRS Abstract https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=104369\">https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=104369", "title": "Regulating Sex: An Anthology of Commentaries on the Findings and Recommendations of the Badgley and Fraser Reports", "subject": "law"}
