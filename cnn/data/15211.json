{"abstract": "Subtle yet entrenched forms of gender-based discrimination continue to disadvantage womens career progress.  Research on sex differences and the consequences of family status for career development and progress suggests that discrimination is alive and well.\n\nGender differences in the work environment need to be considered in order to understand the causes and consequences of inequality and discrimination in the workplace.  There is a rich literature on the benefits of mentoring and networking for career advancement. Yet, few studies have examined the role of mentoring in network related outcomes and consequently our current knowledge and insights about the interaction of demographics and mentoring on network outcomes appear limited.  This gap in knowledge precludes our understanding of mentoring and leadership development, especially for women with children.\n\nOur manuscript addresses this gap.  Specifically, we provide an overview of the important role of mentoring and networking for career advancement focusing on the importance of mentoring on the ability of women to benefit from networking opportunities.  We also describe the results of our empirical study, finding that it is particularly important for women with dependents to have developmental opportunities that are sensitive to how they can benefit from joining networks, while analyzing the relevant legal considerations. Past research suggests that women who are married with or without children or other dependents have more difficulty gaining mentors.  From our data, it is reasonable to conclude that it is precisely these women who need mentoring most. Finally we advocate possible corrections to gender inequities through existing legal remedies.", "title": "The Role of Networks, Mentors, and the Law in Overcoming Barriers to Organizational Leadership for Women with Children", "subject": "law"}
