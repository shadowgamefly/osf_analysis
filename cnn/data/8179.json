{"abstract": "In large cities buildings are responsible for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU, and 70% of energy consumption and 40% of CO2 emissions in the US. Hence, improving the energy performance of buildings is a very cost-effective way to fight against climate change.\nMost of the potential for energy savings is in existing buildings so they provide the greatest opportunities and challenges, but the measures adopted until today to improve energy efficiency, despite some innovative proposals, have been insufficient and mainly focused in new buildings. All the actions developed either by the EU and the US focus on different instruments to foster the renovation of the existing public and private building stock to improve their energy efficiency.\nThese deep renovations are complex and expensive but if they are not committed, then potential savings will be jeopardized for decades. Therefore, to improve the quality of life in large cities, it would be essential to define innovative actions to undertake the energy efficiency objectives.\nAnalyzing the best practices in the US and Europe, the purpose of this research project is, at last, to provide policy makers with the necessary tools to help them achieve the challenge of greening the existing building stock.", "title": "A LEGAL APPROACH TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES: GREENING THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK", "subject": "law"}
