{"abstract": "The article critically examines the objections that professors Guillermo Jimnez, Pablo Marshall and Fernando Muoz have made to the exceptional legislative supermajority rule, defended by Sergio Verdugo in a prior paper of 2012. The objections relies in a biased conception of democracy and political equality. Their arguments conduct to a nave position that prevents the evaluation of supermajorities in an instrumental way. Verdugo defends the idea that legislative supermajorities are useful given certain conditions and under certain cases.", "title": "The Weaknesses of Criticism Against Supermajority", "subject": "law"}
