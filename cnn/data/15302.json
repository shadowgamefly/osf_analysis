{"abstract": "In several states, and many more local governments, teachers are being mandated to teach their students that homosexuality is inherently abhorrent and should be shunned.  These so called No Promo Homo policies vary in scope; from those barring any positive discussion of homosexuality to those which insinuate the association of homosexuality with various social ills.  As a result of these policies, teachers are being used as a conduit for misinformation and, more disturbingly, for discrimination and bias.  Because teachers naturally have an immense impact on their students, the concepts and values advocated or discouraged by them will have an immeasurable effect on the students personal and cultural views. No Promo Homo policies are just one of many factors that contribute to widespread problems affecting the mental health of gay youth, particularly with regard to the recent rash of suicides in this community.  This paper explores the proliferation of No Promo Homo policies, and argues that the implementation of such policies violates the U.S. Constitutions Equal Protection Clause under both traditional rational basis review and rational basis with a bite review.  Further, the paper presents a brief assessment of possible responses to counteract the effects of No Promo Homo Laws around the country.", "title": "See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil; Stemming the Tide of No Promo Homo Laws in American Schools", "subject": "law"}
