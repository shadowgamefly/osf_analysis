{"abstract": "This article maps a way beyond an impasse in todays treatment of philanthropy in both theory and law by taking us back to philanthropys core function, uplifting our neediest and advancing our best.  The standard academic model of philanthropy sees it as subordinate and supplemental to our societys other public sectors, the market and the state, and uses their metrics, aggregate consumer demand and majority voter preference, to measure philanthropys performance.  Thus the standard model gives us, as individuals and as a society, no single measure of philanthropys traditional goal, the public good, besides consumer and voter preference.  This article proposes to reverse the dominant theoretical perspective and reveal a radically different relationship among our societys three public sectors, philanthropy, the state, and the market.  Following both classical western philosophy and the Wests three Abrahamist faiths, this perspective places philanthropy first and measures everything, including our current economic and political systems, by this traditional philanthropic standard:  enabling all human beings to participate in what both the Classics and the Scriptures take to be the highest human function, governing wisely for the good of all.", "title": "The Future of Philanthropy:  Questioning Today's Orthodoxies, Re-Affirming Yesterday's Foundations", "subject": "law"}
