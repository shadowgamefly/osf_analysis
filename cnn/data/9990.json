{"abstract": "Colombia enacted the family old-age pension through Law 1580/12. This pension is not one of exceptional type, which is granted to certain beneficiaries: it is one that tries to expand the coverage of the pension system in a novel way. Thus, the right to a pension no longer will be a product of regular contributions or savings made on an individual basis, but one that will correspond to the sum of efforts made by the couple that makes up a family group. So, in the event that an affiliate not eligible to obtain an old-age pension on an individual basis, it could do so through the fulfillment of the contribution or saving requirement taking on account those contributions or savings made by his spouse, pretending to move from a situation in which two people fail to obtain the pension benefit to that situation on which at least a family group get one single family old-age pension. Obviously the situation poses various challenges that are just starting to consider. This article aims to make a critical approach to the family old-age pension, their characteristics and economic considerations enquiring for his desirability in the Colombian legal system.", "title": "La pensin familiar en Colombia: Una Solucin al dficit pensional colombiano?", "subject": "law"}
