{"abstract": "Oil on Water sheds light on the vital economic and strategic issue of the international oil trade. Oil remains the most important of all fuels, and the viability of the oil trade is highly dependent upon the safety and security of shipping. However, while the idea of energy security is a term widely employed and appreciated in the abstract, the actual details of how the worlds economies are supplied are not well understood. The issue has gained much greater salience in recent years due to structural upward changes in oil prices, mostly as a result of rapidly growing demand in China, India and other Asian economies, as well as conflict in the Middle East and threats to the supply chain posed by piracy and terrorism.", "title": "Book review of Oil on Water: Tankers, Pirates and the Rise of China", "subject": "law"}
