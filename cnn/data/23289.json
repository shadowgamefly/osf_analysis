{"abstract": "This paper argues that the recording industry has abused its power to deny uses of copyrighted music and has failed to satisfy the constitutional purpose of copyright of providing for the public benefit. As a result, this power should be removed and replaced with a compulsory license system similar to the Section 115 Reform Act of 2006 (SIRA), which would create a blanket collective license covering digital reproduction and distribution rights for musical works. Additionally, in order to remove the cloud of uncertainty which surrounds music used in user-generated videos, Congress should consider extending the compulsory license regime to cover audio-visual synchronization rights for user-generated video on websites such as YouTube.", "title": "Ending the Power to Say No: The Case for Extending Compulsory Licensing to Cover Digital Music Reproduction and Distribution Rights", "subject": "law"}
