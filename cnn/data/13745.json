{"abstract": "A recent National Research Council report makes recommendations to research university administration to take proactive steps that ensure policies and resources to create more startups because some university technologies will never be licensed unless licensed to a startup. However, significant effort is needed to give life to new startups; it requires skills and programs not associated with the typical university Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) today. It requires clear university policies encouraging startups backed by seed funding for programs that transform an early-stage invention to something commercially more attractive to potential investors/entrepreneurs. The paper evaluates the case for university startups and finds that the monetary rewards alone from startups are far greater than similar rewards from licenses to ongoing businesses.\nThe study of three contrasting case studies of universities reveals patterns of successful policies and performance. The path to more startups is slow; for medium-term results read the case of the University of Colorado while, for long-term results, read the case of MIT. The lessons from the case studies include: very early evaluation of all inventions for their startup potential, seed funds to develop selected early-stage inventions in the form of proof of concept (POC) programs, hiring and retaining faculty members interested in startups, and networking with the business and investors community.\nThe theoretical model (Figure 2) proposed here explains university initiatives for startups in terms of investment risk reduction and the enhancement of the commercial potential of inventions.", "title": "University Startups as a Commercialization Alternative: Lessons from Three Contrasting University Case Studies", "subject": "law"}
