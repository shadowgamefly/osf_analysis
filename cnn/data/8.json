{"subject": "law", "abstract": "This research explores the differences and similarities between assimilation and acculturation. The goal is to identify the distinct characteristics of these forms of integration and examine the pros and cons as it relates to immigrants in the United States while also providing examples of failures in other countries. This essay also examines the social distancing that occurs as immigrants attempt to melt into a host communitys culture. While it is not the intent to suggest one form of integration should be used over the other, this paper endeavors to highlight the advantages of creating immigration policies that give equal consideration to the strengths and weaknesses of assimilation and acculturation.", "title": "Assimilation Vs.
