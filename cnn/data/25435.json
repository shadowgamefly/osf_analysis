{"abstract": "If offenders with serious mental illnesses generally are no more culpable than otherwise similarly situated juvenile or mentally retarded offenders, then why have they not also been found (as is true for juveniles and the mentally retarded) to be constitutionally exempt from being sentenced to death? The answer lies in the Supreme Courts flawed Eighth Amendment test for categorical prohibitions: the Eighth Amendment imposes a desert limitation on the States ability to punish with death, but the current categorical prohibitions test does a poor job measuring offender deserts and even societal beliefs about offender deserts.\n\nThis article proposes a new Eighth Amendment categorical prohibitions test that focuses principally on barriers to the sentencers ability to determine the moral desert of members of a particular offender-class rather than on the actual moral desert of those in that class. Broadly put, the Eighth Amendment test for categorical prohibitions should ask whether the characteristics of a particular condition are such that there is a substantial risk that the sentencer will privilege utilitarian aims over retributive aims. When the characteristics of a condition (juvenile status, etc.) point simultaneously to significantly reduced culpability and to potential future dangerousness, a categorical prohibition is appropriate if there is a substantial risk that the sentencer will give more weight to the future dangerousness issue than to the moral desert issue. Under this test, the Eighth Amendment should be held to prohibit the death penalty for offenders afflicted with a psychotic spectrum disorder at the time of the crime in question.", "title": "Rethinking Categorical Prohibitions:  How the Current Test Fails Mentally Ill Offenders and What to Do About It", "subject": "law"}
