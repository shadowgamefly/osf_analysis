{"abstract": "Economists have long recognized that certainty of contract is essential to a healthy economy. Long-term forward contracts, in particular, help reduce financial risk. Those contracts can only accomplish that goal, however, if parties know the contracts will be enforced.

Nor do generalized claims of - market dysfunction - at the time the contract was formed.", "title": "Supreme Court Amicus Brief Regarding Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v.
