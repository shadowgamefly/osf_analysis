{"abstract": "The theory of risk-need-responsivity (RNR) has been widely recognized as an empirically-supported model of effective correctional assessment and programming. Developed by Andrews, Bonta, and Hoge (1990), the RNR model advocates matching intervention type and intensity with a particular offenders risk level and criminogenic needs. Rather than providing one-size fits all rehabilitation, this model promotes tailoring an individuals treatment to his or her individual, risk-relevant deficits. Accordingly, it is one of the best examples of the interface between assessment and intervention with offender populations.", "title": "The application of risk-need-responsivity to risk assessment and intervention-planning:  Opportunities, current limitations, and relevant research needs", "subject": "law"}
