{"abstract": "If the brilliant, legendary playwright Rod Serling were still with us, he might have described a law school graduates credentials something like thisconsider if you will, the law school graduates perfect resume: 1) graduated first in his class from Ivy League University; 2) graduated first in his class from Ivy League Law School; 3) law review editor; and 4) elevation to Big-Firm partnership.\nWell, that aint me. I was never a law review editor. I did not graduate in the top ten percent of my class. I did not go to an Ivy League college or law school. I never even finished high school. In fact, the closest I ever came to going to Columbia Law School as a native New Yorker was riding past the 116th Street subway station on the D train. When I lived in Massachusetts, the closest I ever came to attending Harvard aw School (in Cambridge) was driving by there after getting lost trying to find Fenway Park in Boston.\nThat said, it was not as if I scraped by at the bottom of the bar-rel, either. Actually, I did fairly well in law school and graduated with a B average. Thus, I was not exactly overmatched by law school, either. For all of the horror stories about law schooland they are legionthis piece will hopefully advance the position that law school is not the absolutely unspeakable horror that some people make it out to be. Believe it or not, law school can be a positive undertaking. I enjoyed the experience and came out of it (reasonably) sane. Others can do the same.", "title": "Misadventures of a Law School Misfit", "subject": "law"}
