{"abstract": "This February, a World Trade Organisation dispute panel adjudged the National Solar Missions \"domestic content requirement,\" or DCR measuresagreements to purchase solar electricity from power companies on the condition that certain shares of the cells and panels they use be of Indian provenanceto be illegal. In its ruling, the panel cited provisions in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, or GATT, to which India is signatory, prohibiting member countries from giving preference to domestic products over imported ones.This leaves the Indian government in a difficult position. Currently, indigenous solar modules are roughly a third more expensive than imported ones of comparable qualityand without DCRs power companies will naturally opt for these cheaper alternatives. Looking solely at the NSMs targets for generation capacity, this is not a problem, as power companies can continue to increase capacity using only imported modules. But for domestic solar-technology manufacturers it could mean a massive decline, which in turn could rob India of many of the spin-off benefitsfactory jobs, industrial investment, technological advancement, and potential future exportsthat the burgeoning solar-power sector can offer. It is in the countrys interest to continue supporting the development of domestic solar technology, yet it cannot simply ignore the WTO ruling. Fortunately, there are ways to continue nurturing this sector within the confines of Indias WTO obligations. The article talks about this solution.", "title": "Undimmed: Nurturing Indian solar-power technology within the strictures of the WTO", "subject": "law"}
