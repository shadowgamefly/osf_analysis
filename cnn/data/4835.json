{"abstract": "Congress spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year on social programs.  Many dont work. Congress and the President have called for greater reliance on evidence-based programs. Thus far, however, only one major federal program conditions state access to formula-based federal funding on the use of evidence-based practices--the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. In this Article, I examine the extent to which this initial effort has succeeded, concluding that Congress has taken a promising first step, but that attainment of its objective will require more demanding proof standards than those contained in the current Home Visiting Program.  These weaknesses can be fixed.  In this Article, I offer a roadmap for improving the program and for drafting a new generation of evidence-based federal programs that are much more likely to improve the lives of Americas children and families.
