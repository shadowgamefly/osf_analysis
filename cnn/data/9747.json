{"abstract": "This book presents a fresh contextualised and cosmopolitan perspective on comparative law for both students and scholars. It critically discusses established approaches to comparative law, but also presents more modern ones, such as socio-legal and numerical comparative law. Its contextualised approach draws on examples from politics, economics and development studies to provide an original contribution to topics of comparative law.", "title": "Comparative Law", "subject": "law"}
