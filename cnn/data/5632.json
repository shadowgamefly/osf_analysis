{"abstract": "On September 13, 1788 the Continental Congress set the first Wednesday in March, 1789 as the date on which the first federal congress was to launch government operations, that is, principally, building the legal infrastructure of the new government.  Although Congress had the power to move the date set forth in the constitution itself (the first Monday in December, via Article 1, Section 4, Clause 4) for the opening of its annual sessions,  this did not occur until the adoption of the Twentieth Amendment. Section 1 thereof set the opening date for the 74th Congress at January 3, 1935 under its formula. Our Constitutional Logic investigates, via several articles and tables, the aftersession regularly scheduled for December of the even numbered year, which fell two years after the previous round of Congressional elections.", "title": "Table Annexed to Article: Why is March the Fourth March the Fourth?
