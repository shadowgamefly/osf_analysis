{"abstract": "The crucial link between rules and policy is choice. Rules require people to make choices that further policy. In addition, a single rule that is claimed to advance a specific policy involves a behavioral assumption of one kind or another. In this Article, the Author offers some closing observations with regard to the collection of articles from the Teaching Law & Socioeconomics Symposium. The Author's comments fall into two categories. First, he discusses an important theme that he has found throughout the articles: the importance of linking policy with the rules that further those policies by examining the determinants of how choices are made. Further, he argues that it is fundamental to virtually all law school teachings. Second, he focuses on what he perceives to be some of the challenges that socioeconomics must contend with in order to continue to flourish.", "title": "Socioeconomics: Choice and Challenges", "subject": "law"}
