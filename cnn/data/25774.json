{"abstract": "In May, 2008, an international group of 50 negotiation scholars and teachers met in Rome, Italy, to launch a four year project to rethink negotiation theory and pedagogy. From its inception, the Rethinking Negotiation Teaching project (NT 2.0 project) has had two primary goals: to significantly advance our understanding of the negotiation process in all its complexity; and to improve how we teach others about negotiation. The first year of this four-year project focused on generating new ideas and approaches to negotiation scholarship and teaching. Some of this scholarship was published in the book Rethinking Negotiation Teaching and some in Negotiation Journal. These articles call on negotiation teachers and scholars to make a paradigm shift from first generation negotiation thinking toward second generation thinking or, as has been described elsewhere, from Negotiation 1.0 to Negotiation 2.0.\nThe second year of the negotiation project challenged this group of scholars to test and refine these new ideas in practice. The authors of this current article were invited to design a training program based on the emerging Negotiation 2.0 scholarship and to deliver that training at Bilgi University in Istanbul, Turkey.  This article reports the results of the pilot course and offers both conceptual and practical suggestions for further second generation negotiation teaching.", "title": "LESSONS FROM THE FIELD: FIRST IMPRESSIONS FROM SECOND GENERATION NEGOTIATION TEACHING", "subject": "law"}
