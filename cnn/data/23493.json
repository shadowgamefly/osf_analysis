{"abstract": "The Internet poses grave new threats to information privacy.  Search engines collect and store our search queries; Web sites track our online activity and then sell this information to others; and Internet Search Providers read the very packets of information through which we interact with the Internet.  Yet the debate over how best to address this problem has ground to a halt, stuck between those who call for a vigorous legislative response and those who advocate for market solutions and self-regulation.  In 1995, the European Union member states began to build a third approach into their data protection laws, one in which government and industry work together to develop and enforce privacy rules.  This co-regulatory model could provide a way to transcend the frozen U.S. debate.  However, it has received little attention in the United States and almost no analysis in the law review literature.  In 2010, I was awarded a Fulbright Senior Professorship to study the European experiment and to assess whether it might hold useful lessons for the law and policy of Internet privacy.  This is the first of two articles in which I will convey the results of my research.  This article identifies the threats to online privacy; evaluates whether the two main alternativesgovernment regulation, and the market/self-regulationcan adequately address these threats; surveys the theoretical literature on co-regulation; and, finally, describes and analyzes the statutes through which E.U. member states have implemented the new approach.  It provides the first comprehensive analysis of these laws in a U.S. law review and develops an original way of categorizing and understanding them.  In a future article, I will report the findings of my six-month field study of Dutch laws and policies that implement the co-regulatory approach to privacy protection.", "title": "The Law and Policy of Online Privacy: Regulation, Self-Regulation or Co-Regulation?", "subject": "law"}
