{"abstract": "International commercial transactions sometimes give rise to disputes. Resolving these disputes requires access to justice (whether through litigation or arbitration), and access to justice costs moneyin some cases, enough money to overshadow the substance of the underlying dispute. Knowing this, international commercial parties almost always include a dispute resolution clause in their contracts. Yet, despite their prevalence and importance in managing future arbitration and litigation costs, dispute resolution clauses are often poorly negotiated and hastily drafted, perhaps because some factors that affect the cost of resolving future disputes are not known by the parties ex ante. But, while some factors (like the nature of the dispute, enforcement costs, and attorneys fees) may not be known by the parties ex ante, other factors (like the cost of access to justice) can be known by the parties ex ante. For example, parties know ex ante how much they have to spend in court or arbitration fees to gain access to a particular litigation or arbitration forum. Thus, rather than negotiating hastily for a dispute resolution clause, or using boilerplate language, parties can rely on the cost of access to justice information (which can be known ex ante) as one important factor guiding their forum shopping decisions. This Note explains how that can be done in practice. In particular, it defines the cost of access to justice in the international commercial context, examines how disparities in forum fees, adjudicator fees, costs of entry into legal systems, and settlement and refundability prospects inform forum shopping decisions, and provides useful information for international commercial lawyers and businesspeople.", "title": "FORUM SHOPPING AND THE COST OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE: COST AND CERTAINTY IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION", "subject": "law"}
