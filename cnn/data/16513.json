{"abstract": "Inadequate waste management leads to many environmental issues and the adoption of an efficient and sustainable waste management has become a priority objective of the EU. However, besides the demographic factors, the various socio-economic and geographical conditions of this complex space lead to major disparities in municipal waste management between North and South, East and West. This paper aims to do a spatial-temporal analysis of the Eurostat indicators using ascending hierarchical cluster analysis that divides the member states into five typological classes. The resulted maps highlight territorial disparities among Member States on municipal waste management and also reveal the evolution of environmental policies between 2003-2009 related to the EU acquis.", "title": "Disparities in municipal waste management across EU-27.
