{"abstract": "In May 2013, the first all-plastic, 3D printed gun was fired. This paper offers a detailed description of the origins and development of the printable gun. It elucidates the transformation of the principal narrative in the increasing media coverage from circumventing arms regulation to defending free speech, highlighting the role of Defense Distributed and their strategic framing of the printable gun. Finally, the uptake of the latter narrative by early popular and scholarly contributions is discussed. The paper highlights the political impact of narrative formation in debates about regulating 3D printing and the communication of printable designs, and suggests an approach sensitive to the concrete practices involved in printing weapons.", "title": "The Killer Idea: How Some Gunslinging Anarchists Held Freedom of Speech at Gunpoint", "subject": "law"}
