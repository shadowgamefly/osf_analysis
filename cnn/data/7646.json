{"abstract": "What conscientious law professor of first year, large format classes in torts, contracts, or criminal law has not pondered how to better engage students while easing their reluctance to speak out in class? While many students entering law schools are quite adept with student engagement technologies (SETs) from their undergraduate studies, some law faculty seem tied to the passive environment of lectures and PowerPoint presentations and hence reject SET methodologies as so much techno-wizardry. With the entry of web-based programs into the expanding field of SETs, and increasing empirical evidence that interactive learning improves grades, closes gender gaps, and helps the economically disadvantaged student, the ethical question arises, are we not obliged as law teachers to employ them? This paper examines in three steps that gap between pronouncing from the podium and actively learning by remote or online devices. Part I reviews and updates the growing empirical literature on the features of active learning tools. Part II examines two models of SET technology for their comparative attributes and drawbacks, with a particular focus on law teaching. Part III details the authors experiences with the clicker system teaching introductory law and criminology courses and compares its attributes to newer web-based systems. The paper concludes with a look forward to teaching and learning in the emerging culture of the Internet of Things.", "title": "Point and Click versus BYOD: Student Engagement Technologies  as an Ethical Imperative for Teaching Law", "subject": "law"}
