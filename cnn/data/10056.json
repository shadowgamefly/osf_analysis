{"abstract": "The  article  analyzes  mechanisms  established  to control the fulfillment of the EU sustainability criteria for biofuels that were presented in  Directive 2009/28/EC. The article is the continuation of the research started in the work  Pavlovskaia, E. (2013) Controlling the Fulfillment of the EU Sustainability Criteria for Transport  Biofuels, which was published in RELP 4/2013. The conducted analysis is grounded in the opinions  of the leading researchers in the environmental energy studies.  The results of the article highlight that there are difficulties to achieve the desirable quality  of control when the EU sustainability criteria are implemented. It is pointed out that EU allows  the co-existence of voluntary sustainability standards with corresponding sustainability criteria,  benchmarked by the EU Commission, that basically function on their own. What is more, EU relies  much on independent auditors. The results of their work are not double-checked by any of the EU  administrative bodies. This can give rise to fraud at any stage of the production chain.", "title": "Analysis of the Mechanisms to Control the Fulfillment of the EU Sustainability Criteria for Biofuels in Directive 2009/28/EC, (Part II)", "subject": "law"}
