{"abstract": "I invoke Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism outlined in \"The Concept of the Political\" to better understand the European Union (EU) as a governmental institution. It is my contention that the EU is a liberal institution, with the sole intent to drive economic policy while ignoring identity, similar to what Schmitt rails against in his critique of liberalism. For that reason I demonstrate how the EU fits well into the mold Schmitt laid out to identify liberal politics. Therefore I use Schmitt's critique as both a starting point for defining the European Union and, by superimposing his critique onto the EU, I use Schmitt to argue against the future prospects of the Union.", "title": "Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism and the European Union", "subject": "law"}
