{"subject": "law", "title": "The ", "abstract": "One of the most important questions in contemporary design patent law is how to interpret the phrase article of manufacture in 35 U.S.C. &nbsp;289. While there has been much discussion about what Congress intended when it enacted the predecessor to &nbsp;289 in 1887, there has been little discussion about what the phrase article of manufacture meant in 1887. This Article aims to fill that gap. It examines the relevant statutory text, late nineteenth-century patent treatises, Patent Office decisions, and court cases and concludes that, in 1887, the phrase article of manufacture did not mean product or any thing made by hand or machine. Instead, it was a term of art that referred to a tangible itemother than a machine or composition of matterwith a unitary structure made by humans and complete in itself for use or for sale. This historical evidence undercuts both the Federal Circuit and Supreme Court interpretations of the phrase article of manufacture. This evidence also should be considered in evaluating arguments about the statutes plain meaning and the original congressional intent."}
