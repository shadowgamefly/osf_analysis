{"abstract": "My primary interest in Sociology of Law is to analyse the interconnection between social and legal orders, and understand how the socio-legal environment reflects and influences different legal structures. I take up Vagos book Law & Society with this avowed purpose, and also to refine, or perhaps to realign, my sociological imagination. I am also interested to learn research techniques employed in the socio-legal context, and possible uses of such techniques in the area of law I work in. Therefore, my review of Vagos book would not offer any critique, at least from the sociological perspectives. However, I have made certain remarks over internal incoherencies of Vagos ideas about law in chapter one and how he incorporates them into his sociological thinking. My review of Vagos book would, nevertheless, be limited to what I understand and learn from it.", "title": "Book Review: Law and Society (Fourth Edition: 1994), by Steven Vago, Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall.", "subject": "law"}
