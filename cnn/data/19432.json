{"abstract": "This  short piece is an annotated version of remarks  that I gave to introduce  a roundtable discussion on securities regulation scholarship at the  University of Maryland School of Law program on Corporate Governance  and Securities Law Responses to the Financial Crisis held on April 17,  2009.  The piece represents my current thoughts about what it is like to  teach, research, and write in the area of securities regulation.  Ultimately, the message I deliver is a positive one; there is much  opportunity for securities regulation teachers and scholars in an  environment like the one we have been wrestling with since at least the  fall of 2008.  The text is quite short, but I have offered many  citations in support of my ideas in the hope that they may be helpful to  those exploring aspects of the areas I cover.", "title": "The Best of Times, the Worst of Times: Securities Regulation Scholarship and Teaching in the Global Financial Crisis", "subject": "law"}
