{"abstract": "Some states recently have attempted to legislate around a defendants constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel via a novel two-step method.  Step one is to allocate insufficient funds for public defense, which results in excessive caseloads for public defenders.  Sadly, that step is nothing new.  Step twothe one that has slipped by without sufficient notice or criticismis to bar a public defender from withdrawing from representation based on his excessive caseload.  Ultimately, this statutory two-step further entrenches the systematic deprivation of defendants Sixth Amendment rights to effective assistance.\nIn this article, I urge courts to constitutionalize the excessive caseload problem via two steps of their own.  First, courts explicitly should recognize that excessive caseloads create unethical conflicts of interest for the public defenders laboring under them.  Second, courts should equate excessive caseload conflicts with joint representation conflicts.  Once viewed as that type of conflict, excessive caseloads then would be evaluated under Sullivans adverse effect test instead of under Stricklands more stringent actual prejudice test.  Under Sullivan, the most egregious excessive caseload conflicts could be deemed unconstitutional.  As a result, courts effectively could require states to do what few legislatures are willing to do on their ownfinally provide adequate funding for indigent representation consistent with Gideons promise.", "title": "Funding Gideon's Promise by Viewing Excessive Caseloads as Conflicts of Interests", "subject": "law"}
