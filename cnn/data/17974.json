{"abstract": "During his bid for the Presidency, Barack Obama specifically identified work-family conflict as a key issue that would receive attention and reform if he became President. After entering the White House, President Obama continued to consistently articulate that work-family balance issues were a priority for America's families and for his administration. In May 2011, the President reaffirmed his dedication to the issues that face working parents, stating that his administration was, \"striving to help mothers in the workplace by enforcing equal pay laws and addressing workplace flexibility as families balance the demands of work, child and elder care, and education.\"\nObama recognized the challenges America's working families faced due to work-family conflict. Nevertheless, as Obama's first term comes to a close, it is apparent that he failed to take action to strengthen work-family balance. As a result, little has changed for those struggling to combine paid market and family care work. This article will provide a descriptive account of the Obama administration's record regarding work-family balance.", "title": "Off-Balance: Obama and the Work-Family Agenda", "subject": "law"}
