{"abstract": "This Issue Brief considers the scale and magnitude of SGBV directed against women and girls in Timor-Leste. It considers the culture of impunity that pervades the country around SGBV and impedes progress on this issue; the lack of enjoyment of human rights by women and girls due to SGBV; and the systematic failure of the security and justice system to tackle violations. Focusing on both the pre and post-independence eras, it synthesizes the evidence to help identify entry points for the prevention and reduction of SGBV.", "title": "After the Guns Fall Silent: SGBV in TImor Leste", "subject": "law"}
