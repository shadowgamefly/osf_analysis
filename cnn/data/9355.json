{"abstract": "Libertarians like Robert Kane believe that indeterminism is necessary for free will. They think this in part because they hold both ( 1) that my being the ultimate cause of at least part of myself is necessary for free will and (2) that indeterminism is necessary for this \"ultimate self-causation\". But seductive and intuitive as this \"USC Libertarianism\" may sound, it is untenable. In the end, no metaphysically coherent (not to mention empirically valid) conception of ultimate self-causation is available. So the basic intuition motivating the USC Libertarian is ultimately impossible to fulfill.", "title": "The Main Problem with USC Libertarianism", "subject": "law"}
