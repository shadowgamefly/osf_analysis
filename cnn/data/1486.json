{"abstract": "International standards have assumed special legal significance in the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). This article conceptualizes international standards as global public goods and argues for applying global administrative law principles to vet international standards before they are afforded quasi-legislative status in the WTO law. We traced how the WTO Appellate Body has changed its original hands-off approach in EC  Sardines in 2002 to a more intrusive approach in US  Tuna II in 2012. We submit that the WTO Appellate Bodys new approach to international standards marks a distinctive pathway for the development of global administrative law in producing global public goods. The compliance with global administrative law principles set out in the TBT Committee Decision in turn provides international standardizing bodies with additional legitimacy and accountability. &nbsp;However, contrary to popular opinion, we submit that adoption by consensus is not a necessary condition for a standard to be recognized as an international standard in the world trading system.&nbsp;", "title": "International Standards as Global Public Goods in the World Trading System.pdf", "subject": "law"}
