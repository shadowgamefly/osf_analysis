{"abstract": "In recent years there have been two growing trends. First, the trend of municipalities banning the ownership of a variety of dog breeds, particularly the dogs commonly referred to as pit bulls. There is also a growing trend in the ownership of what are called wolf-hybrids, animals that are bred by mixing wild wolves with domesticated dogs. As this ownership has continued to grow, municipalities are searching for ways to control what many see as ownership of animals they consider to be wild. This raises several questions. First, what exactly makes a hybrid animal a hybrid animal? Second, what biological issues may arise within these breeds which give municipalities concern? Third, are these animals wild, domestic, or somehow both? Fourth, how are states and localities currently regulating the animals, and finally how should they be?  Across both the scientific community and the nation the answer to these questions result in a patchwork of varied information, however an ideal solution may still exist for those wishing to either promote or restrict ownership.", "title": "WHOS AFRAID OF THE BIG BAD HALF-WOLF?
