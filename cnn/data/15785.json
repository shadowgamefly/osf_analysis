{"abstract": "There are two deep puzzles in American constitutional law, particularly related to individual substantive rights, that have persisted across generations: First, why do courts apply a double standard of judicial review, giving strict scrutiny to noneconomic liberties but mere rational basis review to economic ones? Second, why does American constitutional law take the common law baseline as the free and natural state that needs to be protected? This Article proposes a technocratic vision of substantive rights to explain and justify both of these puzzles. The central idea is that modern substantive rightsthe rights to speech, religion, association, reproduction, and parentingprotect a discrete set of markets that is characterized by unusually high degrees of economic and moral uncertainty.\nThe Article identifies three sources of economic uncertainty (hedonic centrality, uncertain valence of value, and long/fat tailed distributions) and two sources of moral uncertainty (deep dissensus and pluralism/ambivalence) that are prevalent in all five protected markets. In the presence of those kinds of uncertainty, all theories for distributional success that are relevant in a representative democracy necessarily fail, and from a societal perspective, all distributions of goods within uncertain markets are equally good and equally bad. As a result, regulators cannot hope to improve market distributions from the common law baseline and ought not to try. That said, the modern doctrinal formulation for strict scrutiny allows regulators to intervene when they can identify discrete market failures or moral consensuses within protected markets (when they can write a narrowly tailored intervention to serve a compelling state interest). This caveat further demonstrates that the harm rights seek to avoid is fruitless regulatory tinkering in the face of uncertain costs and benefits.", "title": "Substantive Rights in a Constitutional Technocracy", "subject": "law"}
