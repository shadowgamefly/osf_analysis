{"abstract": "The Holy See/Vatican City State has taken vast measures toward international compliance with Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism laws since 2010. The HS/VCS submitted its original AML/CFT law to a MONEYVAL review. The key takeaway from the MONEVYAL assessment was that the Vatican has come a long way in a short period of time. Most of the deficiencies will be ironed out with continued communication with MONEYVAL, trial and error of enforcing Laws NN. CLXVI and XVIII, and continued efforts toward compliance with other international counter-terrorism conventions. Notably, Law No. CLXVI was passed after MONEYVALs November visit; thus, Law No. CLXXVII was assessed rather than the amended Laws NN. CLXVI and No. XVIII. Were these new laws to have been assessed, the weaknesses would have been fewer and narrower. The HS/VCS will soon be in compliance with AML/CFT Laws if they follow the model laid out by Italy and continue to strive toward the measures enacted in the EUs Directive by continuous MONEYVAL evaluations until compliance is met or exceeded.", "title": "Preventing and Countering the Financing of Terrorism within the Roman Catholic Church", "subject": "law"}
