{"abstract": "This survey covers Florida judicial decisions and legislation that appeared between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2000. As in past years, the volume is huge. So many cases and statutes can have an impact on real estate that we had to limit our coverage to what we thought would be of particular interest to the real estate community. Our goal is to inform our readers of what has happened and, on occasion when we thought it was needed, to voice agreement, disagreement, or suggestions for the future. As always, we urge you to read the original cases and acts. As readers will discover, real estate law continues to develop in interesting ways.", "title": "2000 Survey of Florida Law: Real Property", "subject": "law"}
