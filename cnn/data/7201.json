{"abstract": "The focus of this essay is a growing practice to which we can attach the label Green Zoning  the incorporation of LEED and competing privately generated standards into local government law, as part of the existing zoning or land use ordinance, or as a free-standing green building ordinance. After reviewing some of the pertinent literature on this topic, this essay will highlight and provide illustrations of six problems with Green Zoning practices: 1. The Delegation Problem  Can and should local laws be based on a moving target (standards set by private parties that continue to change and evolve)? 2. The Compatibility Problem  Are some green building standards inconsistent with good planning practices? 3. The Expertise Problem  Are already overburdened local officials up to the task of incorporating, administering, and overseeing Green Zoning? 4. The Eco-Political Problem  How or should local officials factor in the battles waged over green building standards? 5. The Laboratory Problem  Are variations from locality to locality a good idea, or do state standards make more sense in this area? 6. The Philosophical Problem  What role should builders, architects, and industry experts play in shaping zoning and planning ordinances?", "title": "A Yellow Light for Green Zoning: Some Words of Caution About Incorporating Green Building Standards into Local Land Use Law", "subject": "law"}
