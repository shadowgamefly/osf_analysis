{"abstract": "The eBay decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 opens the door for discretionary injunctive relief in patent infringement cases. This essay examines the development of case law and scholarly discussion in the post-eBay era. The author finds eBay illuminates that patents are not private rights that demand full remuneration when being infringed, but rather a tool of incentivizing sufficient innovations to the public. The remedies for patent infringement need not redress all the losses that the patentee suffers, but rather simply reimburse the R&amp;D cost for the purpose of preventing over-incentivizing. Six indicators are put forth to assess the need for incentives to promote specific innovations, which can serve as an excellent guide for courts to adjudicate injunctions and develop a layered remedy system for patent infringement.Developing countries usually face conflicting policy concerns regarding innovations. Discretionary injunctive relief is in compliance with the TRIPS Agreement, and capable of empowering the courts to fine-tune the strength of patents on a case-by-case basis, which assists the developing world to reconcile conflicting concerns. The same six indicators may also help courts in developing countries to use their discretion on injunction relieves more wisely.", "title": "Discretionary Injunctive Relief for Patent Infringement: Partial Remuneration After EBay and Its Implications for the Developing World", "subject": "law"}
