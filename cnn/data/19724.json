{"abstract": "Several legal and non-legal factors determine and shape controlling partys behavior and its ability of extracting private benefits of control through opportunistic conducts that harm minority shareholders.\nInitially, the paper briefly focuses on the concept of PBC and on the ways its magnitude can be assessed. Starting from the quality of the laws enacted and the level of enforcement granted to them in a given law environment (law matter thesis), to other law-related factors such as the level of competition, the labor in the firm, reputational constraints upon management, disclosure standards and the attitude of the judiciary, the paper analyzes the set of constraints preventing corporate control form extracting PBC.\nLastly, the paper focus on the impact that social norms have in influencing controlling partys behavior, therefore curbing or raising the level  of  PBC. Differing social norms may provide an explanation for differing levels of PBC in countries where the law matter thesis fails to provide it.", "title": "What Shapes Controlling Partys Behavior?: Factors behind Private Benefits of Control", "subject": "law"}
