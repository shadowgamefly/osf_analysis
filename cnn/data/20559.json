{"abstract": "Current robot designs have difficulty understanding unstructured environments due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of phenomena in the real world. However, new developments like ubiquitous computing, cloud computing, the Net of Things and next-generation internet technologies should make it easier for networked robots to get structured information about their physical environment. Although these developments may help reduce open texture risk, in fact, risk will be transferred from the physical world into the virtual world. In this paper, the author will try to address some of the resulting legal implications.", "title": "Networked Robots: A Brief Look at Possible Legal Implications", "subject": "law"}
