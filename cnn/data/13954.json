{"abstract": "In July, a federal appeals court ruled that a New York Times reporter must testify in the criminal trial of a former CIA officer accused of improperly disclosing classified information. In May, the DOJ confirmed it had obtained months of phone records of AP reporters and a portfolio of information about a Fox News correspondent. Criticism from the press and public was swift, and in response, the administration attempted to reas- sure the press that it would not be conscripted into the service of law enforcement. President Obama urged Congress to rein- troduce a federal shield bill that would allow reporters to refuse to testify about their sources. The bill's fate is uncertain, and it has generated a debate about the definition of a journalist. Inno- vations in technology have created new channels for people to communicate, complicating the effort to define a journalist. This article explicates the concept of journalist, drawing from the scholarly, legal, and industry domains. The authors hope to con- tribute to the ongoing debate about who may claim the legal privileges for journalists.", "title": "People who arent really reporters at all, who have no professional qualifications: Defining a Journalist and Deciding Who May Claim The Privileges", "subject": "law"}
