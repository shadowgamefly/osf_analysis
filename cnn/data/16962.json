{"abstract": "Harlan Fiske Stone has been largely overlooked in the recent legal literature even though his legacy should influence how we resolve contemporary legal problems.  This article examines Stones archived correspondence, his speeches and opinions, and numerous secondary sources to demonstrate why he is more important now than at any time since his death in 1946.\n\nAs Attorney General from 1924-25, Stones decision to prohibit the Bureau of Investigation (BI, todays FBI) from spying on domestic radicals established a framework that should guide the troublesome relationship between domestic intelligence and law enforcement that reemerged after September 11, 2001.  As an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1925-41, Stones visionary critiques of formalistic, extra-textual interpretations of Congresss power support the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Acts individual mandate.  Even more importantly, Stones devotion to judicial restraint when assessing the constitutionality of laws that he, his Party, and the President who appointed him opposed, contrasts sharply with the troublingly partisan divisions of the current Court.  Finally, Stones dissent in Minersville v. Gobitis, though largely overlooked in the contemporary legal literature, bravely defended the rights of a religious minority suspected of disloyalty during a surge of national paranoia that closely resembles the publics current apprehension toward Muslim Americans.\n\nThis article also analyzes less attractive aspects of Stones legacy, including his appointment of J. Edgar Hoover to head the BI and his opinion upholding the militarys mistreatment of aliens and citizens of Japanese descent during World War II.", "title": "Why Harlan Fiske Stone (Also) Matters", "subject": "law"}
