{"abstract": "The number of nations that have signed and ratified the Rome Treaty of the International Criminal Court continues to expand, but the number of cases prosecuted remains fairly small.  One issue that defies resolution is the place of complementarity in the post-conflict jurisdictional decisions of the I.C.C. and national tribunals.  Although the Rome Statute crystallizes definitions of core international crimes, the interpretation of processes leaving jurisdiction with the nation or allowing jurisdiction to the I.C.C. continues to lack structure.\nOne step that some states have taken in implementing legislation and processes in support of jurisdiction over I.C.C. core crimes is to adopt wholecloth the interpretation of crimes made by the I.C.C. and the Office of the Prosecutor.  Such  an adoption fails to take into account the different levels of jurisdiction allowed to extraterritorial or international tribunalsthose tribunals not within the power of the Stateand the ability of states to challenge the few precedents in international criminal law as establishing standards of process acceptable to states in responding to I.C.C. core crimes.  In acknowledging the debates that have surrounded complementaritypositive complementarity contrasted with the antagonist view that the I.C.C. would seek to usurp jurisdiction given the opportunity; the normative function of a multinational organization versus the ability of state actions and differences to shape customary international law and assist in treaty interpretationthis article recommends a different and complementary normative framework for application of core crimes in national jurisdictions.", "title": "Defying Gravity: the Development of Standards by States in the International Prosecution of International Atrocity Crimes", "subject": "law"}
