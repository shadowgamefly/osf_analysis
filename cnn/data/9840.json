{"abstract": "The study of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), despite their potential therapeutic usefulness, has raised numerous ethical, legal and political concerns because the derivation of the stem cell lines requires the destruction of human embryos. An alternative method for deriving pluripotent cell lines from human parthenotes raises questions about whether these lines are captured by extant legal definitions of the human embryo in the European Union. This paper analyzes the 2012 decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof or BGH) in the Oliver Brstle case, a ruling that allows the derivation of hESCs using methods that do not destroy embryos. We also discuss a case referred recently to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In the context of parthenogenesis, the court has been asked to define what is meant by the expression \"capable of commencing the process of development of a human being.\" We discuss this in light the recent European Patent Office (EPO) decision, which, unlike the BGH decision, has revoked Brstles European patent. We conclude by arguing that the BGH ruling offers hope to the inventors of hESC technologies seeking protection for their intellectual property in Europe.", "title": "EUROPE'S LANDMARK DECISIONS ON STEM CELL PATENTS: FOR INVENTORS, HOPE OR MERE ILLUSIONS?", "subject": "law"}
