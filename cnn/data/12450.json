{"abstract": "With homegrown terrorism an issue of growing concern to the national security community, creating and fortifying bona fide partnerships between law enforcement agencies and American and British Muslim communities has proven successful in preventing terrorist incidents from occurring domestically. This book chapter focuses on the growth of the community policing model and how its success depends on law enforcement infrastructure, as well as law enforcement connections with Muslim communities.\n\nThe chapter sets forth a proactive approach to terrorism rather than a reactive one by supporting a contemporary community policing model based on community partnership and problem solving.  The paper provides numerous case studies demonstrating how the linguistic, cultural and analytical skills of the Muslim community played essential roles in working with law enforcement to fight terrorism in the United States and abroad.  Examples of missed opportunities from tips within Muslim communities further demonstrate how imperative a community policing model is to preventing terrorism.  Finally, the paper provides steps to improving community policing in counterterrorism.  The first step is requiring law enforcement to establish an infrastructure to work with communities in the long term to address all issues that affect them. The second step is to provide mutual education in training both the community and law enforcement on how to look for signs of odd behavior possibly related to terrorism. And lastly, law enforcement must establish clear lines of communication with the community and protocols for responding to valuable community tips.", "title": "Community Partnerships Thwart Terrorism", "subject": "law"}
