{"abstract": "Nanotechnology promises huge potential for innovation in the coming decades.   Globally, countries are scrambling to ensure they will not be left behind by building up their intellectual property regimes.  Strong intellectual property leads to strong innovation.  For the first time in modern history, the United States is not the prime contender for supremacy over this new field of technology.

However, there are still many problems that need addressing including the training of patent players, dealing with the problems of university patenting, and educating the future generation of scientists in United States schools.", "title": "Securing the Future for the Nano Revolution in the United States", "subject": "law"}
