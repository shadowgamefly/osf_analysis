{"abstract": "WHY ARIZONA SENATE BILL 1070 IS CONSTITUTIONAL AND NOT PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW  ABSTRACT  On April 23, 2010, Arizona Governor Janet Brewer signed into law a bill titled the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, commonly referred to as SB 1070.  The law was designed to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States.  This law, along with a set of amendments, set off a firestorm of controversy nationwide, including street protests, economic boycotts, court challenges, and political posturing.  The controversy centers around the broad authority the law gives law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of individuals suspected of being in the United States illegally.  A major fear is that such broad police authority will lead to racial profiling against Hispanics and the abuse of civil liberties.  Not unexpectedly, the federal government sued Arizona to block the legislation.  The case is now before the United States Supreme Court, and the key issue is whether SB 1070 is preempted by federal immigration law where there is neither express nor conflict preemption, but rather a claim that SB 1070 is impliedly preempted by comprehensive federal law that occupies the field.  Fortunately, the Supreme Court case of DeCanas v. Bica provides the right standard for deciding this case.  Applying that standard to SB 1070 produces a clear and fair decision that the Arizona law is not preempted by federal immigration law and is a proper, legal, and constitutional exercise of the states police authority.", "title": "Why Arizona Senate Bill 1070 Is Constitutional and Not Preempted by Federal Law", "subject": "law"}
