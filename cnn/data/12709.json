{"abstract": "Bangladesh, a developing country of the South Asian region, has been suffering from a rampant food adulteration problem for the last couple of decades. Recent studies revealed that numerous deaths along with countless physical illness are happening as the consequences of this ongoing food adulteration. Several attempts have been through to change the food safety regulatory regime (FSRR) of Bangladesh to combat this alarming issue. Unfortunately the situation has hardly been changed. Rather it is getting worse day by day. However, Bangladesh has never changed the regulatory enforcement philosophy of its FSRR to combat this severe food safety concern. The current study will be an endeavour to apply the responsive regulation theory in the FSRR of Bangladesh as an attempt to make the current FSRR of Bangladesh more effective and updated. It has been demonstrated in this paper that responsive regulation can be successfully applied in the FSRR of Bangladesh having some changes and modifications.", "title": "Application of the responsive regulation theory in the food safety regulatory regime in Bangladesh", "subject": "law"}
