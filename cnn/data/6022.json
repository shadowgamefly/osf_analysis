{"abstract": "Even before they walk into their first classroom, law students are convinced that law school is an ultra-competitive game. And in many significant ways-class ranking, grading curves, teaching methods-the competitive nature of law school is reinforced and confirmed. Today, the escalating cost of legal education and shrinking job opportunities nationwide have only fueled the notion of law school as a zero-sum game with very high stakes. Law schools are even ranked based on student competitiveness.' After all, law school has never been an endeavor for the faint of heart.", "title": "", "subject": "law"}
