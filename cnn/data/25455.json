{"abstract": "What processes best explain womens underrepresentation in science, math, and engineering fields in the U.S.? Do they also explain mens underrepresentation in the humanities? Two survey studies across two U.S. West Coast universities (N = 62; N = 614) addressed these questions in the context of two fields: one male-dominated (computer science) and the other female-dominated (English). Among a set of social predictorsincluding perceived similarity to the people in the field, social identity threats, and expectations of successthe best mediator of womens lower interest in computer science and mens lower interest in English was perceived similarity. Thus, changing students social perceptions of how they relate to those in the field may help to diversify academic fields.", "title": "Explaining underrepresentation: A theory of precluded interes", "subject": "law"}
