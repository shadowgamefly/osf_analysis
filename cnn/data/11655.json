{"abstract": "The interpretation of the Second Amendment has been the subject of increased litigation throughout the last several years.  Challenges to the Second Amendment and related legislation tend to create polarized responses from various political organizations.  These responses, commonly in the form of votes in our legislative branch, impede the progress of reasonable measures to reduce instances of violence across the country.  Addressing gun violence in our country must be a goal which exceeds the interest of any political affiliate or lobby.  This article suggests reasonable measures our government can take to address the growing problems with gun violence in the United States.  The measures include ideas ranging from the application of innovative technology to a more comprehensive background check with greater emphasis on the mental health of the applicant.  This article explains ideas for proposed legislation and obstacles such legislation is likely to face. Also included is an evaluation of these obstacles which start in the legislature, by way of various interest groups, and end with differing views of current members of the United States Supreme Court.", "title": "The Second Amendment: A Reasonable Interpretation in the 21st Century", "subject": "law"}
