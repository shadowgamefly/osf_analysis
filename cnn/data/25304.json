{"abstract": "This Article presents a critical survey of the law, ethics and economics of contingent fee arrangements for legal representation.  First, it introduces the contingent fee, its history, and the various forms it takes.  Second, it discusses and proposes changes in the use (or prohibition) of contingent fees in criminal, domestic relations and corporate matters.  Third, it explores the concept of risk and its effect on legal fees, and analyzes various proposals that aim to reform risk-insensitive and uncompetitive pricing.  Fourth, it examines agency problems in the attorney-client relationship that may be affected by fee arrangements, and makes suggestions for overcoming them.  Fifth, and finally, it considers the empirical question of whether contingent fee arrangements promote litigation, and the normative question of whether it matters if they do.  The Articles central thesis is that despite the contingent fees prominent role in the American legal profession, and its infamous reputation in the public sphere, much about the fee is misunderstood, if even considered, and proper analysis reveals its appropriate function, benefits and limitations.\nThe Article will be published in a forthcoming issue of the New York Law School Law Review.", "title": "A Critical Survey of the Law, Ethics and Economics of Attorney Contingent Fee Arrangements", "subject": "law"}
