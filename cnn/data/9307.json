{"abstract": "Relief for battered immigrants is not an obvious national security matter per se, yet remedies are enacted in conjunction with stringent interpretations of immigration law, as though victims pose a security threat.  Discrepancies exist between the immigration laws themselveswhich attempt to secure the United States from disease, violence, and illegal activityand the loopholes within remedies under these laws, unnecessarily removing victims and perpetuating a cycle of fear and abuse.  By displacing the victim, rather than the abuser, the government allows the cycle of violence to continue, while simultaneously breaking up families and creating disorder and instability.\n\nThe economic and societal implications jeopardize Americas stability as a country by: (1) implicitly condoning violence, a gateway to crime and poverty; (2) making these children and women economically dependent on either their abusive spouse and father or America, preventing self-sufficiency and thus Americas economic stability; (3) forcing America to expend more resources to prevent societal degradation; and, (4) showing America to have lessened control over its own population, thus decreasing its credibility internationally.\n\nThis paper addresses how relief for battered immigrants, when implemented with the priority of protecting national security and immigration legislation, creates and perpetuates negative societal consequences.  Rather than strengthening national security, these laws negatively impact the countrys stability, and thus the freedom the American government intends to appropriate.", "title": "Denying Freedom Rather Than Securing the Country: National Security is Undermined by Laws Governing Battered Immigrants", "subject": "law"}
