{"abstract": "There are few moments which may be said to fundamentally alter the course of human events. The advent of the nuclear age in 1945 is clearly one of them.  The nuclear age has many dimensions, the implications of which, seven decades later, are still unfolding.  The oceans are not the focus of the nuclear age, but the affairs of the oceans are deeply woven into its history. This book considers how the nuclear age has affected the oceans and the legal regime of the oceans. The Law of the Sea of Institute undertook the Oceans in the Nuclear Age Project because we found the knowledge in this field to be highly fragmented.  Consequently, there exists a surprising gap in research on the overall question of the impact of the nuclear age on the oceans and on ocean law and policy, a question of tremendous scope.  This book presents the results of the first phase of that research project.  For us, this book serves to frame the complex multidimensional set of relationships between the oceans and the nuclear age, uncovers patterns of impact and response in the legal regime, and raises further questions for research.", "title": "THE OCEANS IN THE NUCLEAR AGE", "subject": "law"}
