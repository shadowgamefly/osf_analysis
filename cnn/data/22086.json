{"abstract": "The U.S. Copyright Act grants copyright owners the exclusive right to distribute their copyrighted works. The first sale doctrine, codified in  109(a) of the Copyright Act, curtails these distribution rights by exhausting the owners exclusive right after the copyrighted item is placed in the stream of commerce.  However, it is not clear whether the language used in the Act, copies made under this title, is inclusive of copies manufactured aboard or limited to copies manufactured in the United States.  Section 109(a) recently came up for interpretation by the Supreme Court in Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Omega S.A.; yet, the Courts holding did little to clarify the ambiguity surrounding the application of the first sale doctrine.  The Courts failure to resolve the issue has the potential to cause significant harm to the U.S. economy and eliminate the rights of consumers and small business.\nThis Article suggests that the solution is to incentivize Congress to amend  109(a) and bring it into conformity with the true aims of copyright law, to promote knowledge via creation and distribution.  In doing so, Congress should redraft this portion of the Act broadly to accommodate the domestic sale of copyrighted goods lawfully manufactured and sold abroad.  Expanding the first sale doctrine in this manner will yield new discoveries and will stimulate learning, in accordance with the aims of copyright law.", "title": "Applying Copyright Theory to Secondary Markets: An Analysis of the Future of  17 USC  109(a) Pursuant to Costco Wholesale Corp. v.
