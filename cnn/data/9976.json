{"abstract": "Prior research suggests that infelicitous choice of questions can significantly underestimate childrens actual abilities, independently of suggestiveness. One possibly difficult question type is indirect speech acts such as Do you know questions (DYK, e.g., Do you know where it happened?). These questions directly ask if respondents know, while indirectly asking what respondents know. If respondents answer yes, but fail to elaborate, they are either ignoring or failing to recognize the indirect question (known as pragmatic failure). Two studies examined the effect of indirect speech acts on maltreated and non-maltreated 2- to 7-year-olds post-event interview responses. Children were read a story and later interviewed using DYK and Wh- questions. Additionally, children completed a series of executive functioning tasks. Both studies revealed that using DYK questions increased the chances of pragmatic failure, particularly for younger children and those with lower inhibitory control skills.", "title": "Young Childrens Difficulty with Indirect Speech Acts: Implications for Questioning Child Witnesses", "subject": "law"}
