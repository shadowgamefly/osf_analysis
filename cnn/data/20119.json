{"abstract": "As an increasing number of Americans are unable to afford an attorney to help with urgent legal problems, they are left to navigate a complex legal system on their own.  In the effort to motivate more attorneys to provide desperately needed pro bono services, law schools must play a greater role in introducing students to the value and importance of pro bono work.  This article contends that by implementing a program which offers students meaningful pro bono work that is both educational and easily accessible, law schools can involve more students in pro bono activities.  The article also offers an approach to creating such a program whereby students meet with pro se litigants to help them better understand and prepare for their upcoming encounters with the legal system.  This informational counseling role is ideally suited to law students, providing them the opportunity not only to give valuable assistance to those in need, but also to meet with real clients and gain experience in essential skills that cannot be taught in a classroom.", "title": "Expanding Pro Bono's Role in Legal Education", "subject": "law"}
