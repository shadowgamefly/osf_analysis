{"abstract": "The article analyzes the extent to which the current intentional race discrimination standard is consistent with the publics understanding of discrimination.  The analysis reveals that the public has a broader concept of discrimination than the courts. This finding is important because, as many scholars have argued, race and discrimination are not static concepts controlled by the courts.  Rather, they are socially constructed concepts.  Courts, however, have too often ignored social norms in arriving at race discrimination standards, limiting the conversation to themselves.  While many in the academy have noted the Supreme Courts disregard for social norms and cultural context in race discrimination cases, few articles systematically studied the substance of those norms.  This article does so through a case study of the publics reaction to a cartoon that ran shortly after President Obama took office.  By collecting, categorizing, and analyzing these responses, the article is able to offer unique insights into popular understandings of race and discrimination.  In particular, the article examines whether the courts current race discrimination standard is consistent with public norms.  Ultimately, it demonstrates that the Supreme Courts understanding of discrimination is inconsistent with publics reality.", "title": "Cultural Norms and Race Discrimination Standards: A Case Study in How the Two Diverge", "subject": "law"}
