{"abstract": "Electronic data processing systems are being seriouslyconsidered for use in legal research, and a veritable floodof articles has appeared in various legal periodicalsspeculating about the use to which such systemscan be put in legal context. The general tone ofthese articles is understandable, for \"we are all groping toachieve a better understanding of the relation of thesedevelopments in communication technology and law, andit is to be expected that discussion will be vague and generalat the outset.\" As one step in the direction of moreexplicitly defining the role of computers in the law, ProfessorAllen presents a specific proposal for improving thedrafting of legal documents so that some of the logicalanalysis of the contents can be performed automatically.He then applies this proposal to sample sections of thefederal estate tax.This Article is not easy reading, and a casual glance atthe text may unfortunately discourage all but a few fromeven beginning it. But the steps as Professor Allen hasdrawn them are gradual and are not difficult to follow.Should you decide to work through the Article, we thinkthat your knowledge and appreciation of this potentialrevolution in legal methods will be greatly enhanced.", "title": "Beyond Document Retrieval toward Information Retrieval", "subject": "law"}
