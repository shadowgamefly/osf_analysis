{"subject": "law", "title": "Enhancing public engagement on offshore wind energy using genius loci: A case study from a Lake Michigan coastal community", "abstract": "We describe a novel approach to public engagement on offshore wind energy based on genius loci (spirit of a place). North America lacks offshore wind farms but they could be viable in the Great Lakes. Cultural ties between coastal Michigan, USA and the Netherlands offered opportunities to learn from the Dutch offshore wind experience. Residents from a Lake Michigan coastal community with Dutch heritage videoconferenced with a Dutch tourism specialist regarding the Egmond aan Zee offshore wind farm. Important differences and similarities between the regions emerged, including the clustering of technological expertise, tourism effects, and perspectives on working seascapes. Michigan has more private coastal property than the Netherlands which has implications for the visual/aesthetic impact. About 80% of seminar participants agreed that the Netherlands experience with offshore wind was applicable to coastal Michigan suggesting the place-based forum grounded in genius loci may have enhanced the public engagement efforts."}
