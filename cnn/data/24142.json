{"abstract": "We use a standard growth regression model and show that ethnic tensions reduce per capita growth rates.  We also find evidence that good economic and political institutions improve per capita growth rates.  More importantly, good economic institutions mitigate the effect of ethnic tensions on per capita growth while good political institutions do not.  Consequently, it is foremost capitalist freedom that promotes peace and development.", "title": "Reducing the Impact of Ethnic Tensions on Economic Growth  Economic or Political Institutions?", "subject": "law"}
