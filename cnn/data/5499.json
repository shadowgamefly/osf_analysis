{"abstract": "In todays difficult economic times, state gov-ernments are more hard pressed than ever to come up with new sources of revenue to at least stay reve-nue neutral. Leave it to the perpetually money-hun-gry State of New York to come up with this gem of an idea for generating tax revenues: In 2005, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance at-tempted to impose sales tax on a nightclubs offering of exotic dancing to its customers. This resulted in the matter of 677 New Loudon Corp. v. State of New York Tax Appeals Tribunal, ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals in October 2012, where one nightclub instigated a legal challenge to the states attempt to impose sales taxes on exotic dancing.", "title": "New York's Taxable Lap Dancing...at a Strip Club Near You!", "subject": "law"}
