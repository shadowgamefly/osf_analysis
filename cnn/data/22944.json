{"abstract": "The thesis of this paper is that a harmonised International Commercial Arbitration Law Code (HICALC), governing MENA- FI and Oil Concession Contracts between Middle Eastern Governments and foreign investors would resolve serious conflicts. The additional question of State intervention in trade is implicated here when States prevent the enforcements of Arbitral Awards or encroach on Arbitral Tribunal jurisdiction. A HICALC can resolve the weaknesses inherent in these laws when dealing with MENA-FI and Oil Concessions. This paper will demonstrate how, by drafting a HICALC that integrates general principles of law from civil, common and sharia law, the central problem facing foreign investors party to International Commercial Arbitrations in the MENA, namely that of Arbitral Award Enforcement, can be settled in a balanced and fair way for both sides with ensuing economic value to both the State and the investor. Relevant regulatory clauses taken from each of these aforementioned areas of law will be analysed to show how they may be improved and redrafted into a new HICALC. An economic background of the MENA and implications for European investors and economies will be given. Recent trends in emerging markets of the MENA, global economic trends and benefits of foreign investment will be discussed. It will be shown that Arbitral Award enforcement is important part of economic development.", "title": "State Intervention, Conflicts and Harmonised Commercial Arbitration Law Code", "subject": "law"}
