{"abstract": "In the past two decades, Central and Eastern European countries have experienced a rapid political, economic, social transformation. This transformation has been intertwined with the Europeanization and modernization of the law. The paper analyses the different paths of the renewal of private law in Central and Eastern Europe, with or without recodification, with a special emphasis on the Hungarian case. I discuss the conflicts between academic and political, as well as material and symbolic interests in the drafting of new civil codes. I also identify how mechanisms of legal transplantation, legal technical assistance, and regulatory competition impact on the structure and substance of national private law codifications in the region.", "title": "Drafting Civil Codes in Central and Eastern Europe: A Case Study on the Role of Legal Scholarship in Law-Making", "subject": "law"}
