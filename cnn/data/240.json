{"subject": "law", "title": "DSpace: One Schools' Use of an Open Source Institutional Repository", "abstract": "A variety of resources, both proprietary and open source, have evolved in recent years to enable the collection, preservation, indexing and distribution of digital work, as well as to provide communities for peer review of works in progress. These emerging technologies make it more feasible to advocate for open access to scholarly communication. This presentation discusses the movement toward open access to scholarly information, as colleges and universities struggle to gain more control over and retain more rights to their scholarly output, and the consequences of not doing so. The speaker will also describe the various options currently available for establishing an institutional repository within a law school setting."}
