{"abstract": "Statistics show that eighty percent of marine accidents are attributable to human error.  While human error is not completely preventable, setting firm rules in a timely fashion and enforcing them can greatly reduce the probability of shipping accidents, and therefore, oil spills. Curbing human error is squarely within the purview of federal law and the Coast Guards delegated regulatory powers. This article suggests that the Coast Guard should take a page from the Federal Aviation Administration and tighten its regulations, especially those concerning drug and alcohol testing, mandatory work hour limits, and vessel traffic management. The Coast Guard should also work to create a culture of compliance by enforcing its regulations and imposing penalties.", "title": "Booze, Pills, and Oil Spills: The Need to Tighten Regulation of the Shipping Industry", "subject": "law"}
