{"abstract": "The U.S. Supreme Court has developed a deferential First Amendment Doctrine that can be used to uphold laws that target speakers on the basis of the content of their speech. This so-called secondary effects doctrine relies on a fictional premise: state and local laws that target certain forms of speech are actually aimed at the adverse secondary effects of the speech. The doctrine supposedly applies to any form of speech that produces secondary effects. It also theoretically permits targeted speakers to challenge the constitutionality of such laws by disproving the existence of secondary effects.\n\nNevertheless, lower courts have impliedly limited the scope of the doctrine to sexually oriented businesses and have effectively eliminated the possibility of successful evidentiary challenges to legislative findings of such effects.  Consequently, lower courts have not only failed to properly follow the doctrine, but they have also threatened the security of free expression. This Note discusses possible alternatives to the current approach that can, inter alia, safeguard free speech rights and reduce doctrinal inconsistency.", "title": "The First Amendment Right to Bare All: How Should Courts Apply the Secondary Effects Doctrine to Strip Bars and Other Sexually Oriented Businesses?", "subject": "law"}
