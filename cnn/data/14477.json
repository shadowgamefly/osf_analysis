{"abstract": "Misunderstanding the concept of race as based in biology is the root error of Professor Nancy Leong's recommendation of a switch to \"perceived race\"  in antidiscrimination law in order to protect multiracial persons from illegal racial discrimination.  Once race is understood as socio-historically constructed and context-dependent rather than as rooted in biology, antidiscrimination law need only add multiracial persons to the categories of specially protected groups in order to protect multiracial persons from illegal discrimination.", "title": "Antidiscrimination Law and the Multiracial Experience: A Reply to Nancy Leong", "subject": "law"}
