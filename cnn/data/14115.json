{"abstract": "The attached article, \"The Promise of Parentheticals: An Empirical Study of the Use of Parentheticals in Federal Appellate Briefs,\" reports an empirical study of federal appellate court briefs to answer the question: How are parentheticals currently used for rhetorical purposes in appellate briefs to explain a synthesis of authorities? My hypothesis is that parentheticals currently are used beyond a simple informational function in citation forms for four rhetorical purposes: (1) to quote and highlight portions of authorities (quotation function); (2) to explain and illustrate the principles induced from a synthesis of authorities (explanatory synthesis function); (3) to explain and illustrate the effect and operation of public policies underlying the law in multiple authorities (public policy synthesis function); (4) to explain and illustrate the narratives of success or failure among multiple cases in which the law was applied to produce a concrete outcome (narrative synthesis function).  These uses of parentheticals will be compared with other methods of communication of information about authorities, specifically textual, case-to-case analogical reasoning and footnoting.", "title": "The Promise of Parentheticals: An Empirical Study of the Use of Parentheticals in Federal Appellate Briefs", "subject": "law"}
