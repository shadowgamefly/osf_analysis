{"abstract": "This article analyzes how the Supreme Court of India, through its activism and assertiveness, has emerged as arguably the most powerful court among democratic polities. Over the past four and a half decades, the Court dramatically expanded its role in the realm of rights and governance, asserting the power to invalidate constitutional amendments under the basic structure doctrine, control judicial appointments, and govern in the areas of environmental policy, monitoring and investigating government corruption, and promoting electoral transparency and accountability. In this article, I argue that the Courts shift toward greater, yet selective, assertiveness in Indias governance can most adequately be explained by a new theoretical approachelite institutionalism. This theory posits that the unique institutional and intellectual atmosphere of the Court shaped the institutional perspectives and policy worldviews that drove activism and selective assertiveness in governance. Elite institutionalism expands the scope of regime politics and institutional theories by situating judicial decision-making within the larger intellectual context of Indian judging. The identities of justices on the Indian Supreme Court are a subset of their overall intellectual identity and worldviews, which they share with professional and intellectual elites in India. This article illustrates how elite meta-regimes of opinionthe collective values and currents of professional and intellectual elite opinion on sets of constitutional or political issuesshaped justices worldviews. The broader shifts in the Courts activism and assertiveness reflected a shift from the meta-regime of social justice to one of liberal reform.", "title": "The Rise of Judicial Governance in the Supreme Court of India", "subject": "law"}
