{"abstract": "It's a common opinion among law and and economics scholars that with a regime of strict liability or a regime of negligence rule one party (but just one party) adopts an efficient level of activity. It's also a common idea the with a regime of strict liability and a tax on the victim equal to expected damage both parties take an efficent level of activity.  We expalin in this paper why this opinions are wrong. The basic fact is that it is not considered by these opinions that, in order to have an efficient level of activity, it's necessary a complete internalization of social costs, but the solutions proposed don't consider that must be internalized also parties' costs of precaution.  We state for this reason that it's possible to have an efficient level of activity by the injurer, for example,if there is a regime of strict liability and it is introduced on the injurer a tax equal to victim's cost of precaution. We also say the, if it's desirable to have an efficient level of activity on the part of the victim, it'a necessry a regime of negligence with a tax on the victim equal to the injurer's cost of precaution.  The paper ends analyzing the possibility to put on both parties a tax equal to the other party's cost of precuation. But the resarch on this peculiar topic is left for other works.", "title": "The Failure of Decoupling Liability and Other Mistakes in Tort Law", "subject": "law"}
