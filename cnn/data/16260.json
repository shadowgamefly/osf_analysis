{"abstract": "In 1994 Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA).  In many ways a rather extraordinary law, CALEA puts the government in charge of determining interception standards for telephone switches.  Under CALEA, switches in use were to be retrofitted to accommodate the new requirement. That there were long-term consequences of building backdoors into long-lived electronic switching equipment were essentially ignored. That lapse is increasingly problematic.  The possibility that security threats would develop against the telecommunications infrastructure itself does not appear to have been discussed during CALEAs passage.  The seriousness of the security lapse has become apparent with  During the last decade, cyberexploitation, an intelligence-gathering activity that can include the theft of intellectual property including business plans, research, and patent data, has become an increasing threat to the United States. Compromising a communications switch creates a problem of enormous scale.\n\nWe are now in a problematic security situation of our own making, on in which a law ---CALEA --- mandates a security vulnerability in U.S. communications infrastructure.  This paper first explores the problem, and then focuses on the technical and policy means to rectify this situation.", "title": "The Large Immortal Machine and The Ticking Time Bomb", "subject": "law"}
