{"abstract": "The position of Ryan Amacher, Robert Tollison, and Thomas Willett (ATW) can be summarized as follows: Assuming that the domestic industry behaves like a profit-maximizing monopoly, if the quota on imported crude oil is replaced by a tariff that is by assumption set so as to achieve the same domestic price of crude oil, the market power of the dominant domestic firms is \"severely constrained.\"\nIn response I would contend that 1) their assumption about the level of the tariff differs from what I had assumed; 2) their conclusion about the market power of the dominant firms is subject to question; and 3) their assumption about the behavior of the domestic industry is difficult to reconcile with the available data.", "title": "Import Controls on Foreign Oil: Reply", "subject": "law"}
