{"abstract": "The University of Chicago Press has just published The Death Penalty, Volume One (The Seminars of Jacques Derrida) translated by Peggy Kamuf. They are the lectures of the late continental philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) on capital punishment. Derrida is the author of deconstruction (if deconstruction were allowed to have an author) and has a reputation for being, let us say, opaque in his writings.\nIn his later years, he took up certain legal and political issues in a fashion that seems more intelligible. Particularly, Derridas lectures on moral subjects were popular in the United States as well as Europe. The particular lectures on the death penalty were originally given from December 8, 1999, through March 22, 2000, and were updated and re-presented through the year 2003.", "title": "Capital Punishment in Recent Literature -- Jaques Derrida", "subject": "law"}
