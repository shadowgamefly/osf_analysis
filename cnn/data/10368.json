{"abstract": "In March 2013, one of the world biggest PC retailers, Dell, announced its privatization plan, in which adopted the go-shop clause. Although used by many public companies in merger and acquisition, the go-shop clause in fact developed from Revlon duty, that board of director must act in good faith to maximize the shareholders interests in the deal.\n\nGenerally speaking, since traditional no-shop clause without fiduciary out provision in merger agreement conflict with boards Revlon duty, consequently, if running successfully, the go-shop clause is the best tool for shareholders to maximize their interests. However, court imputes many restrictions on the board involving with go-shop deal. In Netsmart shareholder litigations, Delaware Court of Chancery held that even there is a fiduciary out clause, the target board still violated Revlon duty against shareholders. According to this case, the boards fiduciary duty and the future application scope of the go-shop clause become even more vague and complex than before, along with the diversified risks attached to the go-shop deal.\n\nThis paper will mainly compare the go-shop and no-shop clause in public companys merger and acquisition, then along with spinning the go-shop lure, where specified the potential risks in go-shop deal. Finally, the author will discuss several proposals when dealing with deals containing either go-shop or no-shop clause.", "title": "The Go-shop Lure: Go-shop v.
