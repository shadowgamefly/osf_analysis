{"abstract": "This Essay (part of the panel on \"The Administrative State and the Constitution\" at the 2009 Federalist Society Student Symposium) suggests that the persistence of debates over delegation to agencies cannot persuasively be explained as a determination finally to get constitutional law right, for nondelegation doctrineat least as traditionally stateddoes not rest on a particularly sound legal foundation.

Whether or not one shares these concerns, they are not trivial, and we should voice and engage them directly rather than continue to use nondelegation as a stalking horse.", "title": "Deconstructing Nondelegation", "subject": "law"}
