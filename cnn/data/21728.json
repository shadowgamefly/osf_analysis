{"abstract": "This chapter provides an overview of United States childrens law, framed both in terms of autonomy-based and needs-based rights, and by the legal dynamic among child, parent, and state.  The chapter highlights the law of juvenile justice and child welfare systems, and also examines law relevant to education and health care, two central institutions for children. The chapter proceeds ecologically, acknowledging that childrens lives, including their legal lives, are related to their families, communities, and the social institutions surrounding them. As such the chapter provides a readable introduction to childrens relationship with the law for both lawyers and non-lawyers.", "title": "Children's Rights and Relationships: A Legal Framework", "subject": "law"}
