{"abstract": "Agricultural production in Nigeria like in other developing countries is highly vulnerable to variations in climatic parameters which may have inverse or direct effect on the performance of food crops. This paper examines the patterns and trends of the variations in the climatic parameters and the implications of such variations on efficient yield rates of some food crops in Benue State using data on climatic variables (rainfall, temperature, sunshine) and the yield of some crops per hectare for 25 years (1986-2010). Data on the climatic variables were collected from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, AirForce Base, Makurdi while the data on food crop yields were collected from Benue State Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (BNARDA), Makurdi. Data were analyzed using multiple correlation and time series analysis. Results show that the climatic parameters and food crops were characterized by high inter-annual variability. All the climatic parameters except rainfall amount, temperature and sunshine were on downward trend together with rice and maize.  The joint effect of the climatic parameters on the yield of all the crops varies between 78% (Yam) and 36% (Groundnut). Among the seven climatic parameters, sunshine and rain days have the highest influence on the yield of all the seven crops while dates of onset and duration have the least influence. The implications of the findings on agricultural development and food security in Benue State have been highlighted.", "title": "Variations in Climatic Parameters and Food Crop Yields: Implications on Food Security in Benue State, Nigeria.", "subject": "law"}
