{"abstract": "In 2010, the Supreme Court handed down the landmark case of Padilla v. Kentucky. The Padilla Courts holding was that failure of counsel to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. This paper addresses whether Padilla applies to cases that are brought based on convictions that occurred before Padilla was decided, in March 2010. First, this paper considers how lower courts have addressed the issue of retroactivity. Then this paper critically analyzes the common arguments for and against applying Padilla retroactively. This paper concludes by arguing that both Supreme Court precedent and fundamental fairness dictate that Padilla should apply retroactively.", "title": "Supreme Court Precedent and Fundamental Fairness Dictate that Padilla v.
