{"abstract": "This Article uses the case of Oscar Pistorius  the South African runner and amputee who competed with blade-like, lower-leg prostheses  to analyze how the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF), the world governing body of track and field, should regulate elite athletes use of innovative prostheses. The Article argues that the Court of Arbitration of Sport correctly decided that Pistorius should be permitted to compete in able-bodied competitions, but that the IAAF rule on which the decision was based failed to account for the full range of sports values implicated by the use innovative prostheses. The Article proposes that IAAF amend its rule to incorporate more sports values, including protecting athletes safety and preserving the fundamental nature of the sport, and clarify how it would assess new technologies in the future.", "title": "Is It Cheating to Use Cheetahs?: The Implications of Technologically Innovative Prostheses for Sports Values and Rules", "subject": "law"}
