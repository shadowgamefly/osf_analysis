{"abstract": "Abstract  Since 2006, the ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific has conducted Thematic Reviews of specific areas of its members' anti-corruption efforts. Through the Reviews, the Initiatives Steering Group takes stock of each members efforts, identifies challenges that have been encountered, and proposes recommendations for a way forward in order to overcome these difficulties. The reviews also identify cross-country trends and common obstacles, which in turn allow the Initiative to tailor its capacity building activities to address these challenges. The first Thematic Review in 2006 focused on members anti-corruption efforts in public procurement. A second Review in 2007 looked at extradition, mutual legal assistance and asset recovery in corruption cases.  In 2008, the Initiative chose the criminalisation of bribery as the topic for its third Thematic Review. Criminalisation is a key component of all international anti-corruption instruments, such as the Initiatives Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific; the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC); and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (Anti-Bribery Convention). In this paper aims  compare  and improve 2 members efforts from Asia  India and  Pakistan in this area and thus strengthen their fight against corruption.", "title": "THE CRIMINALISATION OF BRIBERY IN INDIA AND  PAKISTAN", "subject": "law"}
