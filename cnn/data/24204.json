{"abstract": "The Environmental Protection Agency has issued three new Clean Air Act regulations targeting greenhouse gases, as a response to the Supreme Courts ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA.  One of these proposals, the Tailoring Rule, seeks to adjust the applicability thresholds that trigger the prevention of significant deterioration and title V permit requirements.  EPA is attempting to use the Tailoring Rule to soften the blow of new greenhouse gas regulations on both businesses and state permitting agencies.

Legal challenges to EPAs actions are looming and the standard of review the court selects will determine whether we witness absurd results or a vacated rule.", "title": "EPAs Attempt to Regulate Greenhouse Gases Under the Clear Air Act: Will Chevron Allow the Tailoring Rule to Withstand Judicial Review?
