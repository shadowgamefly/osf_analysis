{"abstract": "This paper examines The Republic of the Marshall Islands v. The United States of America et al., the grounds for its dismissal, and recommendations for how it should be appealed and ultimately judged.  The Marshall Islands sued alleging noncompliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  At issue are concepts of legality and ethics behind the Political Question Doctrine defense that the United States provides, in addition to whether or not the Marshall Islands has standing.  When noncompliance with a valid, legal treaty causes real harm, Political Question Doctrine should not be allowed to the extent it was here.  The judiciary must take up its mantle as referee, and declare right or wrong as it is empowered to do under the Constitution.  At a minimum, declaratory relief would not result in a coup against constitutionally apportioned Executive power, but rather hold it within its bounds.", "title": "Unchecked Political Question Doctrine: Judicial Ethics at the Dawn of a Second Nuclear Arms Race", "subject": "law"}
