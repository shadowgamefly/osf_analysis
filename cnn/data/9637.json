{"abstract": "The existing Rule 11 of the FRCP can be immediately harnessed to help solve the patent troll, nuisance-lawsuit problem.  Currently there is the perception that too many litigious entities, commonly referred to as patent trolls, are creating too much dead-weight economic waste in society.  The popular view is that there has been an alarming rise in the number of patent trolls that make no products but try to monetize patents by filing dubious patent infringement lawsuits merely to extract money from commercially productive companies that actually make products and use technologies for societys benefit.  Defining patent troll is probably too difficult to do in a statute aimed at inhibiting patent trolling activities, and in addition, any entity can go patent trolling.  However, a federal court sitting in equity has the power to police much patent trolling after litigation has begun by using Rule 11 and the powers inherent in the federal trial courts.  A novel proposal is to immediately block patent trolling using the wide use of sua sponte Rule 11 motions.  This approach is preferable to proposed fee-shifting approaches to non-prevailing, patent-infringement claimants that might not only fail to effectively stop patent trolling but might weaken the patent system by being overinclusive thereby resulting in the inhibition of legitimate patent litigation and the liquidity of patents.  The flexibility of judicial discretion is preferred for handling unique patent trolling behaviors, evolving exploitations of inefficiencies in the legal system and, most importantly, the difficulty in defining a patent troll in statutory language, which could be gamed by litigious entities acting in bad faith.", "title": "Inhibiting Patent Trolling: A New Approach for Applying Rule 11", "subject": "law"}
