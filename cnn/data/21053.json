{"abstract": "The fast melting glacial mass of the Arctic seems to be affecting the native population in more ways than one. In addition, the diplomatic dialogue over the Northwest Passage sea route which, according to certain reports from Climate Change research organisations, could make an ice free trade transit route that would prove to be an astounding 4000 miles reduction from the route otherwise taken is far from reaching an all-factor-encompassing, reasonable conclusion. Will this passage really be ice-free? Is it possible that this pristine and fragile ecosystem of the north would be able to accommodate such sudden violation and exploitation? What are Canadas rights of sovereignty in the region? Would the economical benefits outweigh the environmental damage that is inevitably caused? Or should we just be green global citizens and leave it be? The researcher takes a deeper look at what should, would and could be.", "title": "THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE ISSUE: A FROSTY HORNET'S NEST", "subject": "law"}
