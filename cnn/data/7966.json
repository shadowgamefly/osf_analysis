{"abstract": "Fertility in women declines significantly at age thirty-two and takes a sharp downward turn at age thirty-seven.  Miscarriages also increase with age.  In vitro fertilization cannot reverse the effects of aging, and embryo screening, egg freezing, and egg donation are imperfect solutions.\nUnfortunately, many women fail to grasp these facts until it is too late.  Various factors are to blame, including physicians who shy away from the topic of age-related fertility decline, persistent messaging about the need for pregnancy prevention (implying that conception is easy), and media accounts of celebrities who are pregnant in their forties.\nThis Article argues that obstetrician/gynecologists should take a more proactive role in sharing the facts about age-related fertility decline with their patients.  In addition, states should amend their education laws to require that sex education courses taught in public schools cover not only birth control and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but also age-related fertility decline.", "title": "Teaching the Biological Clock:  Age-related Fertility Decline and Sex Education", "subject": "law"}
