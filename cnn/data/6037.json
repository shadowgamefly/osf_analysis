{"abstract": "In Capital Area District Library v. Michigan Open Carry, 826 N.W. 2d 736 (2012), the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that state law preempted the librarys weapons policy prohibiting firearms in the library.  My article, Can I Bring My Gun? A Fifty State Survey of Firearm Laws Impacting Policies Prohibiting Handguns in Public Libraries,* asked how laws in each state impact similar policies prohibiting handguns in public libraries.   The article warned that many states and the federal government were in the process of amending laws to increase or decrease gun restrictions, and that ongoing change could be expected. In fact, since the article was published in December, 2013, over half the states have amended or promulgated statutes impacting the issue.    This update provides a more accurate baseline for following gun laws in the states and District of Columbia.  Where information in the original article remains the same the text has not been changed.", "title": "2015 Update: Can I Bring My Gun?
