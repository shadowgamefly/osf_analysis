{"abstract": "As Perry v. Schwarzenegger seemingly makes its way to the Supreme Court, LGBT advocates are staking their legal claims around the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause  arguing for the designation of LGBTs as a suspect or quasi-suspect group.\n\nThe desire for suspect class designation is in vain though. In the late 1970s, the Supreme Court closed the set of suspect and quasi-classifications, and the set will likely remain closed. Around the same time, the Court faced a series of affirmative action cases in which it was forced to choose between two approaches to equal protection: antisubordination and anticlassification. It chose; the anticlassification approach came to control the Courts equal protection jurisprudence.\n\nThis Note contends that the Supreme Courts choice, on one hand, to elevate the anticlassification approach above antisubordination, and the Courts refusal, on the other hand, since the late 1970s to designate any more groups as suspect or quasi-suspect, were not mutually exclusive events. Rather, this Note argues, the former caused the latter.\n\nWith Perry v. Schwarzenegger in mind, this Note offers the LGBT community an alternative way of thinking about litigation strategy by casting light on the Supreme Courts new approach to equal protection.", "title": "PERSONAE NON SUSPECT: SEXUAL ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE SUPREME COURTS NEW ANTICLASSIFICATION REGIME", "subject": "law"}
