{"abstract": "Using andragogical theory developed by Malcolm Knowles as a foundation as well as a counterpoint, this article presents a new framework for teaching clinic students.  Frustrated by tensions they encountered in teaching students whom they expected to have all the qualities of adult learners, the authors developed a new theory that blends humanistic as well as developmental theory.  The article describes this new theory and evaluates why it works in clinical teaching.", "title": "Not Quite Grown Up: The Difficulty of Applying an Adult Education Model to Legal Externs", "subject": "law"}
