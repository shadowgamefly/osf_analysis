{"abstract": "Multinational corporations engaging in natural resource extraction are often enticed by nascent foreign regulatory regimes and private dispute settlement mechanisms intended to induce investment. The result of a complicit government and poor operational practices can be environmental devastation and widespread human rights violations for which there is little redress. This paper analyzes the challenges inherent in using private dispute resolution mechanisms to hold corporations accountable for regulatory violations through the lens of Texacos 30-year operations in the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Aguinda v Chevron litigations in New York and subsequently Ecuador. The case represents the one of the most significant examples of a group of foreign plaintiffs potentially holding a multinational corporation accountable for its tortious acts in a developing country. The decades-long litigation that followed Texacos operations in Ecuador has offered little in the way of corrective justice for its plaintiffs. It may however, prove an effective deterrence by showing oil companies and other multinationals that they may be held to account for human rights and environmental violations even where domestic countries were complicit in non-enforcement of regulations. Despite the enormous hurdles plaintiffs face, the case may begin to signal to multinationals that exploiting the race to the bottom in regulations by capital-starved developing countries may backfire in the long run on their balance sheets, especially with a few minor, but potentially instrumental reforms to speed and provide finality in these private dispute settlement actions.", "title": "Delayed Justice: A Case Study of Texaco arnd the Republic of Ecuadors Operations, Harms, and Possible Redress in the Ecuadorian Amazon", "subject": "law"}
