{"abstract": "In June 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the standard of proof for patent invalidation in Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Limited Partnership, et al. The Court held that an invalidity defense to be proven by clear and convincing evidence rather than by a preponderance of the evidence and that burden is constant and never changes. Compared to the U.S. patent system, there is no heightened standard of proof required for patent invalidation in infringement suits in Japanese courts and the invalidation rate is high especially after Kilby cas in 2000, where the Japanese Supreme Court decided that a patentee could not enforce a patent when it is clearly invalid because the enforcement is deemed to be an abuse of the right.  In this article, I will discuss the need to raise the standard for patent invalidation in Japanese infringement cases making a comparison between the U.S. patent system and Japanese patent system focusing on the standard of proof.  In order to promote future growth by leveraging innovation, inventers and applicants should be incentivized by increasing patent credibility and making enforceability foreseeable by implementing clear and convincing standards in the Japanese patent system.", "title": "Standard of Proof for Patent Invalidation in the U.S. and Japan", "subject": "law"}
