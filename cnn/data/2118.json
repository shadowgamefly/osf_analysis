{"abstract": "On  March 4, 2015, the Department of Justice released its scathing report of  the Ferguson Police Department calling for an entire reorientation of  law enforcement in Ferguson and demanding that Ferguson replace  revenue-driven policing with a system grounded in the principles of  community policing and police legitimacy, in which people are equally  protected and treated with compassion, regardless of race.   Unfortunately, abusive collection of criminal justice debt is not  limited to Ferguson. This Article, prepared for a discussion group at  the Southeastern Association of Law Schools conference in July 2015,  identifies the key findings in the Department of Justices report and  discusses the major points to be learned from the allegations in  Ferguson. The lessons learned from Ferguson should be a guide to other  municipalities that are or may be on the brink of developing similar  abusive collection practices.", "title": "Lessons Learned from Ferguson: Ending Abusive Collection of Criminal Justice Debt", "subject": "law"}
