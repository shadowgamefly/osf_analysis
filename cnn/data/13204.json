{"abstract": "In the last of three articles, OCL surveys the deployment of constitution through The Federalist Papers, the bank bill debates and the remainder of Madisons life (post-presidency).  Numeric values for hits are computed for the range of semantic values, with the focus being constitution = text (locatable in only one place) competing with constitution = government. A net score is proposed which measures the effort an author has expended to cleanse his semantic palette by employing one semantic value over a competing value.", "title": "Table Annexed to Article: Hamilton and Madison Deploy Constitution In Works Dated to 1787/88, 1790/91 and 1817-1836 Surveyed by Percent of Words in Source", "subject": "law"}
