{"abstract": "This is a foreword to a compendium of writings by our lost friend and colleague, Bobby Lipkin, collected within a special issue of the Widener Law Review.\n\nBobbys constitutionalism beholds and celebrates that \"no constitutional truths emanate from either politically unaccountable\" courts or from paradigmatically imperfect constitutional legal theories. Rather, Bobbys constitutionalism was participatory and justificatory: it derives from the Constitutions republican democracy. The Constitution means what We the People allow it to mean at constitutional inflection points in our nations history.\n\nWe miss Bobby dearly.", "title": "Foreword - In Memory of Robert J.
