{"abstract": "The incorporation of non-profit bodies in Nigeria is governed by the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2004 (the Act). The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) is vested with responsibility for non-profit organisations. The CAC has branches in most State capitals of the Federation and its headquarters is based in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. Before applying to the CAC for incorporation of a non-profit body, one must check that the name of the new entity is not already in use. This can be done by purchasing an Availability Form, which costs very little. In Nigeria only legal practitioners, and to some extent accountants, are allowed to file applications at the CAC. Such persons should be accredited by the Commission to act on behalf of it. The organisation seeking to be established must have a constitution drafted by a legal practitioner.  The Act provides that, where one or more trustees are appointed and authorised by a community of persons, they may apply to the CAC under the Act (section 590(1)) for incorporation of the entity they represent (known as incorporation of trustees). This community of persons may be bound together by custom, religion, kinship or nationality, or also by association of persons established for any religious, educational, literary, scientific, social, development, cultural, sporting or charitable purpose.", "title": "Guide to Incorporation of Not for Profit Organisations in Nigeria", "subject": "law"}
