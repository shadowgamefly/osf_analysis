{"abstract": "The microfinance industry, once touted as one of the best hopes for alleviating poverty in rural India, faced a near collapse in the winter of 2011 as nearly all borrowers in Andhra Pradesh, one of the largest states in India, stopped repaying their loans. This borrower backlash was fueled by widely reported stories of farmer suicides and unscrupulous lending practices. Politicians have responded with populist legislation aimed at curtailing microfinance in Indiafor example, by capping interest rates. The Article argues that these proposals are misguided in that they would constrict lending to poor villagers.\nThe Article questions why Indian policymakers have overlooked the role of legal debt relief in addressing these grievances and stabilizing lending in rural India. Strengthening the consumer bankruptcy laws in India, I argue, can help stabilize the development of consumer finance while addressing the legitimate grievances raised by the microfinance rebellionnamely, the imbalance of power that exists between lender and borrower. Doing so may reduce the political pressure to adopt misguided proposals restricting microfinance, which would hurt the very people that such laws are meant to protect.", "title": "How Consumer Bankruptcy Reforms Can Help Save Microfinance in India", "subject": "law"}
