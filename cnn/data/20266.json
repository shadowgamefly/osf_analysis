{"abstract": "During February 2011 the prospect of creating a state bankruptcy chapter burst onto the national conversation. This debate largely centered on the necessity of state bankruptcy as a means of averting state bailouts, while some commentators vaguely invoked the need to tread gingerly on state prerogatives under the 10th Amendment. However, the constitutionality of bankruptcy-for-states demands closer scrutiny given that the Supreme Courts recent 10th Amendment jurisprudence has evolved in the direction of protecting state sovereignty.\nThe Article examines a pair of cases from the 1930s that contested the constitutionality of municipal bankruptcy, and argues that the principles handed down from these cases would likely support upholding a state bankruptcy chapter that is carefully drawn to respect state sovereignty. Though highly relevant, these cases are not dispositive because the legal landscape has changed a great deal since the 1930s. The Article argues that even a broad state bankruptcy chapter is constitutional because recent 10th Amendment jurisprudence does not preserve traditional state functions, and the Court has already upheld many similar infringements on state sovereignty, such as the interference with state contractual obligations.\nAssuming a state bankruptcy chapter is constitutional, is it a good idea? The Article assesses the main justification expressed for the creation of a state bankruptcy chapterthat is, it is necessary to avoid a massive federal bailout because states, like major financial institutions, are too big to failand concludes that the grim logic of bailouts applies to the states because they are significantly interconnected with the financial markets.", "title": "Hey Uncle Sam, Can You Spare a Couple Billion?: Examining the Constitutionality of a State Bankruptcy Chapter", "subject": "law"}
