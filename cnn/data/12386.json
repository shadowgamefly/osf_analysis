{"abstract": "Punitive  damages are generally available in common law jurisdictions, but are  disfavored in civil law systems. This paper argues that the main reasons  for the difference are historical and cultural. Roman law and the  French Revolution heavily influenced the civil law. Civilians were  taught that legal development comes from the top down. They learned to  treat law as a system of general principles and to resist anomalies.  They found it relatively easy to reject the intrusion of criminal themes  into private law. The common law developed one case at a time, with no  particular emphasis on systematic coherence. It was comparatively easy  for lawyers to convince judges that juries in tort cases should be  allowed to punish defendants for egregious misconduct.", "title": "A Common Lawyers Perspective on the European Perspective on Punitive Damages", "subject": "law"}
