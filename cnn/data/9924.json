{"abstract": "The judicial elections debate has once again claimed the national spotlight with the Supreme Courts 2009 decision in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. and with the 2010 electoral defeat of three Iowa Supreme Court judges who joined an opinion striking down Iowas law refusing to recognize same-sex marriage.  Judicial election opponents generally criticize elections as interfering with judicial independence, while election advocates laud them as a means to increase judicial accountability.  What can be overlooked in these debates, however, is that judicial elections are not the source of the threat to judicial independenceinstead, that threat arises from re-elections, or from the possibility (even under some appointive systems) that judges can be removed from the bench because of disagreement with their decisions.\nThis article begins by deconstructing the most prominent arguments in the judicial elections debate to show that judicial retention, rather than judicial selection, implicitly drives the arguments.  Building on this focus, the article shows that non-electoral retention systems can threaten judicial independence in ways similar to judicial elections.  It then examines other factors that play a role in judicial independencenamely, the length of judicial terms and limits on the number of terms a judge may serve.  Finally, the article concludes with a proposed retention system that uses term length and term limits to better balance judicial independence and accountability.", "title": "Why the Judicial Electons Debate Matters Less Than You Think: Retention as the Cornerstone of Independence and Accountability", "subject": "law"}
