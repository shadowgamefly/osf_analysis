{"abstract": "Following a brief historical sketch of the condominium concept from its earliest mention in historical documents, this bibliography traces the legal development of condominium homeownership in America to the present day.  Although condominium has developed in some countries, such as England, under common law concepts, special statutory provisions have directed this form of ownership in the United States.
