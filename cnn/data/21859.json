{"abstract": "Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) proposed rules and forms to implement Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), entitled Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protection, and sought comment thereon. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted on July 21, 2010 (Dodd-Frank), established a whistleblower program that requires the Commission to pay an award, under regulations prescribed by the Commission and subject to certain limitations, to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about a violation of the federal securities laws that leads to the successful enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action, or a related action. Dodd-Frank also prohibits retaliation by employers against individuals that provide the Commission with information about potential securities violations. Comments were requested by the Commission and could be submitted on or before December 17, 2010. The Auditing Standards Committee of the Auditing Section of the American Accounting Association provided the comments in the letter below to the Commission on the Proposed Rules for Implementing the Whistleblower Provisions of Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.", "title": "Comments by the Auditing Standards Committee of the Auditing Section of the American Accounting Association on the Securities and Exchange Commission Proposed Rules for Implementing the Whistleblower Provisions of Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934", "subject": "law"}
