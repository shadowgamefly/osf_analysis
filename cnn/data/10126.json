{"abstract": "Two  problems of wildlife will be addressed in this article - one is spatial  and the other is temporal. The first problem is the lack of identity  with, and therefore support for, international wildlife law that local  populations have. That leads to the second problem, which is the failure  to apply the lessons learned from biodiversity law of fauna to the  biodiversity problems of flora. As to the spatial problem, if we make a  simple comparison between a map of biodiversity hotspots and a world  geopolitical map, we can see that the hotspots worldwide fall largely in  developing countries. In these countries, if law can provide solutions  to biodiversity problems in general, and wildlife problems in  particular, we must pause and consider which sources of law that could  mean. That same comparison of maps would also correlate to a map of  colonialism in Africa, Aisa, and South America. Studies have further  demonstrated the relatively high correlations between colonialism and  corruption.", "title": "A Strong Role for Custom in International Wildlife Litigation", "subject": "law"}
