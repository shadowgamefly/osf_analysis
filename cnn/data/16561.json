{"abstract": "A new family of weaponry has manifested itself in recent years in the realm of cyberspace.  Though they rarely cause physical damage, cyber attacks can have debilitating effects on their targets and are becoming more common.  As the weapons become more advanced and destructive, their legitimacy vis existing jus in bello and jus ad bellum international law regimes remains unclear.  Attempts to rectify this problem are either overbroad or simply impossible.  This article reviews the history and development of cyber attacks and the responses they have triggered.  It argues that cyber attacks are sui generis weapons and should not be grafted into existing legal regimes, but instead a new regime should be created organically through state and international response to attacks.", "title": "The Ambiguity of Cyber Attacks in International Law", "subject": "law"}
