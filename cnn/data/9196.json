{"abstract": "This comment argues that a City of Miami ordinance prohibiting begging, soliciting, and panhandling in the Downtown business district is constitutional because it is aimed at combating the secondary effects of soliciting.  Traditionally, courts have analyzed content-based and content-neutral speech restrictions using strict and intermediate scrutiny tests, respectively.\nThis comment urges courts to use  the secondary effects test applied in City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., where the court upheld a zoning ordinance prohibiting adult movie theatres from locating within a certain distance of residential homes.  The court focused on the purpose of the ordinance, which was to prevent crime, maintain property values, and protect residential neighborhoods. The ordinance was upheld because the ordinance was not aimed at the content of the films shown, but rather at the secondary effects of adult theaters.\nLikewise, the Miami Ordinance should be scrutinized using a secondary effects analysis because the Ordinance's purpose is to protect and promote tourism and economic vitality.  The Ordinance is not aimed at suppressing speech.", "title": "BEGGING TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL", "subject": "law"}
