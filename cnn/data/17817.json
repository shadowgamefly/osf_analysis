{"abstract": "This chapter responds to the contribution of Professor Ted Sichelman in the same volume by reconsidering the UK courts method of determining patent scope. Using my earlier work regarding the role of eligibility as a determinant of patent scope as the departure point for that reconsideration, I argue that the theory of patent eligibility scope proposed in Sichelmans chapter runs against the grain of UK patent jurisprudence by virtue of its uncertain and open-ended policy nature, and is therefore unlikely to be accepted by the UK courts. On the other hand, recent UK cases such as Schtz v. Werit can be read as going to the other extreme by eschewing regard to policy that might limit the protection of the patentee. Such cases invite reconsideration of the UK courts method of determining patent scope. Hence the aim of this contribution, which is to undertake such a reconsideration drawing on jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union and (UK and European) copyright.", "title": "Patent Eligibility and Scope Revisited After Schtz v.
