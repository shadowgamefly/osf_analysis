Smith, And O. Carter Snead As Amici Curiae In Support Of Petitioners", "abstract": "Suppose a federal law required government officials to enter a Catholic church and use church property to distribute contraceptives and abortifacients over churchs objection. Such a law would surely burden the churchs religion, even if the government paid for the objectionable medications and compensated the church for the use of its resources. By commandeering church property, such a law would force the church to be complicit in activity to which it has serious religious objections"}
