{"abstract": "With the transition of Hong Kong under a new constitutional order coalescing with the fact that it would continue to practice capitalism within a socialist framework it was only natural that conflicts would arise. Employing the concept of sovereignty and autonomy in other autonomous societies as a yardstick, this paper will examine whether Chinas encroachment in Hong Kongs high degree of autonomy is consistent with the principle of One Country, Two Systems. In doing so, we will study Hong Kongs executive, legislative and judicial power with the special ability to conduct external affairs. Although Hong Kong was excluded from exercising residual powers in paper, yet it was granted other powers which will also be examined. Though China may see intervention in Hong Kongs affairs as a necessary step to maintain territorial integrity, yet this paper will show that in the long term this may do more harm than good both in the international arena and to its capability of maintaining the trust of the Hong Kong people in its own government and the Central Peoples Government, for whom trust is vital in order to succeed in their current reforms.", "title": "Hong Kong's Constitutional Structure: is it really a high degree of autonomy?", "subject": "law"}
