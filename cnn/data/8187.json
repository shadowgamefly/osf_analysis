{"abstract": "Private information is no longer stored only in homes or other areas traditionally protected from warrantless intrusion. The private lives of many citizens are contained in digital devices no larger than the palm of their handand carried in public places. But that does not make the data within a cell phone any less private, just as the dialing of a phone number does not voluntarily waive an individuals right to keep their call log or location private. Remember that we are not talking exclusively about individuals suspected of committing violent crimes. The Government is recording the calls and locations of citizens who have done nothing wrong, who are driving to work while talking to their spouses, or who are using their cell phones to call a loved one in the hospital.  And technological advancements have enabled the Government to know where you areand record the numbers you are calling.  Unless it has a good reason for doing sooften referred to as probable cause or reasonable suspicionthis practice should have no place in a society that values civil liberties.\nDo the Governments surveillance practices make us safer? Maybe. Should that matter? No. Assurances that we are safer come at too high a price if the cost is to our personal freedom. That may make us safer, but it also makes every citizen less secureand a little hesitant before dialing a number or downloading a YouTube video. If the Court were to permit these and other warrantless intrusions into a persons private life, the Fourth Amendments place on the constitutional hierarchy might be just a notch above the Third Amendments prohibition against the quartering of soldiers, or slightly below the often discussed but never-used Privileges and Immunities Clause. Simply put, Riley came at the right time, and hopefully is the beginning of enhanced protections for privacy rights.", "title": "Riley v.
