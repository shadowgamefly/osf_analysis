{"abstract": "This paper examines the legal frameworks of both Australia and the United Arab Emirates as it relates to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) international treaty. It explores the wording of the treaty and its subsequent implementation in those jurisdictions citing both legislative and jurisprudence around the notions of Technical Protection Measures. It is through the examination of the operationalization of this term that the limited effect of this treaty and the need for more explicit definition of terminology utilized is evident. This clarification will assist in the identification of the role that law can play in terms of more defined and effective legal remedies.", "title": "A Comparative Study of the Legal Frameworks and Protection of Digital Content in the United Arab Emirates and Australia in Relation to the Practice of Blocking Digital Content on the Basis of Location (Geo- Blocking) and its Associated Circumvention Technologies", "subject": "law"}
