{"abstract": "This paper is the first to be written for publication in an American law journal addressing the ground leasing dimensions inherent in solar power generation facilities development.  Far from being a leasing manual, the paper describes in some detail the processes of preliminary investigation, venture formation, development and financing of a solar generation plant, enabling the reader to appreciate those issues underlying the negotiation and documentation of a leasehold conveyance.  A form of lease appears as an Appendix to the article, which fleshes out provisions that encapsulate the respective vital interests of the parties to the lease transaction as well as the requirements of the energy consumer, who may choose after lease inception to acquire the solar facilities in conjunction with its ongoing use of those assets output.", "title": "Current Events: Reflections on Solar Power Generators' Leasing of Vacant Tracts", "subject": "law"}
