{"abstract": "In the last decade the Supreme Court has modified the compelled-speech and commercial-speech doctrines by creating a hybrid of the twocompelled-commercial speech.  This nascent doctrine leaves unanswered serious questions about how it coexists with other doctrines in the First Amendment landscape.\nThis paper proposes a principled means to resolve these questions by drawing on an innovative behavioral-science theory called Cultural Cognition to provide a system for categorizing forced commercial-speech regulations.  By establishing which test applies to determine whether regulations violate the First Amendment, this framework should help bring consistency and predictability into a murky area of First Amendment law.", "title": "YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN!: A WAY OUT OF THE COMPELLED COMMERCIAL SPEECH CONUNDRUM", "subject": "law"}
