{"abstract": "Will contests involving testators with diminishing capacity present a number of challenges to attorneys and courts.  One such challenge is the fact finding process to balance concurrent allegations of testamentary incapacity and undue influence.  While a lack of testamentary incapacity and undue influence are two distinct grounds for avoiding a will, many courts have had conflicting opinions on whether a finding of undue influence is dependent upon a finding of requisite testamentary capacity or whether the two findings are mutually exclusive.  This article attempts to provide a general understanding of basic concepts and theories relating to will contests of testators with diminishing capacity and the conflicts of law relating to such.  Because the common law differs from state to state, the author uses examples from Missouri, New York, and Texas to show how laws vary across jurisdictions.", "title": "Balancing Testamentary Incapacity and Undue Influence: How to Handle Will Contests of Testators With Diminishing Capacity", "subject": "law"}
