{"abstract": "The Establishment Clause is home to both procedural and substantive disorder.  Particularly in evaluating religious speech by the government, the Supreme Court applies any of a number of distinct tests, with varying degrees of strictness.  At the same time, the Court has articulated a series of requirements necessary for a plaintiff to have standing to challenge government action, only to ignore them in government religious speech cases.  The resulting lack of clarity leaves lower courts to their own devices in endeavoring to calm increasingly intense struggles.  This article sets out a theory that altering one of these problems can correct the other.  Analogizing to the Treaty of Westphalias temporal limit, the Supreme Court could restrict standing to claims against current government activity.  Such a limit would foreclose the ability of pro-religion forces to newly dominate the public square, but would also prevent anti-religion forces from removing the vestiges of past government activity that are central to the American experience.  Current doctrine ends with many of the same results, but doing so under the standing doctrine would remove the camouflage of alternative substantive tests.  Such clarity could help achieve real religious freedom and peace in the national dialogue.", "title": "Standing on Holy Ground: How Rethinking Justiciability Might Bring Peace to the Establishment Clause", "subject": "law"}
