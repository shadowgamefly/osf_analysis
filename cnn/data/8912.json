{"abstract": "The fight against nonconsensual genital normalizing surgery, a primary concern of the intersex community, has gained traction within recent years but needs more support from the larger LGBTQ movement. Using an allyship framework, this Article argues that any such support be based on the lived experiences, concerns, and voices of the intersex community itself; in the past, well-intentioned efforts have advocated for solutions other than those sought after by the community, oftentimes resulting in negligible or even harmful results.\n\nThe solution sought after by the intersex community is an immediate moratorium on the practice of nonconsensual genital normalizing surgery, a procedure that has historically been accepted by the medical world as necessary. Theorists and scholars have responded to the problem by suggesting solutions that challenge the sex / gender binary construction, either through 1) the creation of a third gender, and / or 2) the removal of government identification practices that require specification of a particular sex / gender.\n\nThe focus on deconstruction of the sex / gender binary has not resulted in a cessation of nonconsensual genital normalizing surgery in any of the nations that have adopted such policies internationally. The solution has also been denounced by intersex activists for miscomprehending the issues and for failing to listen to the expressed concerns of the intersex community itself. Despite this criticism, nations are still adopting these same flawed policies, most recently embraced by Germany in 2013. Future support should embrace the allyship framework, acknowledging the input and concerns of actual members of the community, and shift focus to seeking an immediate moratorium on the medical practice.", "title": "Allyship to the Intersex Community on Nonconsensual Genital ", "subject": "law"}
