{"abstract": "With the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) in 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) received the daunting task regulating swap markets. Following two iterations of proposed guidance and comment periods, the CFTC released its finalized Interpretive Guidance and Policy Statement Regarding Compliance with Certain Swap Regulations (Guidance) on July 26, 2013. In the Guidance, the CFTC gives its interpretation and policy outlook for promulgating rules with respect to the regulation of cross-border swaps. This paper examines both the critiques of the Guidance, including issues of international comity and rule promulgation procedures, and the potential effects on the global economy.", "title": "Has the CFTC Gone Too Far in Trying to Keep the American Economy Safe from Cross-Border Swaps?", "subject": "law"}
