{"abstract": "Our present housing crisis is related in part to practices of real estate agents.  This article addresses the top three issues that cause the most disputes for agents.  They are dual agency, disclosure, and breach of fiduciary duty.  Despite legislative efforts in the past two decades to clarify and reduce the duties of dual agents, agents and consumers are still confused about agents who represent both sellers and buyers.  They owe double, not half the loyalty owed to one principal.\nThe stakes are high because home ownership is critical to our economic recovery and the chief source of wealth for most Americans.  This article advocates single agency, but provides concrete guidelines for dual agency when it is used.  A proper cultivation of the double duty of loyalty, transparency and greater communication among agents, buyers and sellers will lead to better house pricing and fidelity and fairness in our real estate market.", "title": "Dual Real Estate Agents and the Double Duty of Loyalty", "subject": "law"}
