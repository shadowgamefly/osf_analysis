{"abstract": "The relationship between classical political liberalism and racism poses distinct puzzles for different schools of scholarship. On the one hand, conventional accounts maintain that racism has been an aberration in politically liberal regimes. In the field of international migration, prominent analysts have argued that politically liberal regimes are inherently incompatible with legal discrimination based on race. Yet an examination of immigration and nationality laws throughout the Americas from 1850 to 2000 suggests that racial discrimination has been more common in liberal than in illiberal countries of immigration. These empirical findings puzzle scholars who assume (1) the progressive extension of rights from white, land-owning men to their working-class subordinates, other ethnic groups, and women, and (2) the status of the United States and Canada as exemplars of liberalism. On the other hand, critical theorists of race and the law argue that liberalism and legal categorical exclusions have been mutually constitutive. This camp tends to juxtapose the praxis of liberal regimes to their rhetoric ultimately to show how the praxis comes up short. However, few scholars in this vein have explored this process over the long run by studying cases that vary in their degree of institutional liberalism. From this perspective, the puzzle is how and why politically liberal countries moved away from laws with categorical exclusions, allowing countries like the United States and Canada to undergo massive ethnic transformation. This article engages each of these puzzles.", "title": "Liberalism and the Limits of Inclusion: Race and Immigration Law in the Americas, 1850-2000", "subject": "law"}
