{"abstract": "At the beginning of the Twentieth century, a strong high court, be it national or supranational, represents a guarantee of democracy and rule of law against political parties and other organizations particular interests (at the national level) and states (at the international level). The push for reason-giving is a key factor in this new institutional order.

Quite the reverse, reason- giving has become a legitimatizing factor for judicial power.", "title": "Les cours souveraines et leur nouveau public", "subject": "law"}
