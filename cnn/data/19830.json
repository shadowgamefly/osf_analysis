{"abstract": "The case of Garcetti v. Ceballos, decided by the United States  Supreme  Court  in  2006,  established  that  a  public employees job related communications are not protected by the First Amendment. The Court also held that an employer has the right to impose disciplinary  sanctions against that employee  based  on  those  job  related   communications. Although  the  Court  specifically  did  not  address  how  its decision  would  affect  public  university  professors  in  the future,  Garcetti  has   already  alarmed  academicians  who believe in the concept of academic freedom. College professors, especially those who teach in research institutions,  are  now  concerned that  the  Garcetti  decision poses a serious threat to academic freedom. In academia, the perceived threat is that in the future, cases similar to Garcetti will  lead  to  public  university  professors  losing  their  First Amendment protection, and thus be subject to discipline for their on the job speech. This note will look at the factual dispute leading to the Courts  decision, as well as the dissent. It will also look at how the issues of  job status, citizenship, and controversial speech are connected with academic freedom. This note will also look at a glaring potential problem regarding the issue of equal protection, and\tfinally comes to the\tconfident conclusion that academic freedom will ultimately prevail.", "title": "Has Garcetti Destroyed Academic Freedom?", "subject": "law"}
