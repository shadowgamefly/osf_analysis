{"abstract": "Pierre de Fermat, a licensed lawyer, legislator, and an amateur mathematician, was an odd but perhaps the most productive and rare-power mathematician of his era, making colossal contributions: the calculus, maxima and minima, the number theory, the least-time principal, the sine law of refraction in optics, among others.  Fermat was the first person known to have evaluated the integral of general power functions. Using an ingenious trick, he was able to reduce this evaluation to the sum of geometric series. The resulting formula was helpful to Newton, and Leibniz. Fermat also contributed in B. Pascal's probability theory.  Fermat' last theorem is about a Diophantine equation, which poses the stiffest of all challenges. It was decoded only three centuries later, in 1994.  Majority of the costly scientific inquiries in medicine do not necessarily bring home results. Written by a medical doctor (Naira R. Matevosyan), this monograph is the first attempt ever to review Fermat's last claim (the Diophantine), as well as his Little Theorem in the context of exploring predictive attributes in clinical and epidemiological studies, and the gene expression analysis.", "title": "FERMAT`S LAST CLAIM: Rethinking of the Diophantine Equation in Clinical Research, Epidemiology, and Human Embryology", "subject": "law"}
