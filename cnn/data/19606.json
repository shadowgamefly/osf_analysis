{"abstract": "Following the 2008-2009 Israeli-Hamas war, the Human Rights Council dispatched a fact-finding mission headed by South African Jurist Richard Goldstone to investigate the hostilities. In September 2009, the mission issued its findings in a nearly 500-page report containing a variety of complaints against Israel, the most explosive of which was that Israel, as a matter of state policy, intended to kill Palestinian civilians and destroy their property.  A year and a half later, Justice Goldstone reconsidered the missions conclusion, acknowledging that Israel may not have deliberately targeted Palestinian civilians during the conflict. This paper argues that Justice Goldstones reconsideration of the reports most contentious conclusion implicitly confirms the most serious criticisms of the report: the mission failed to provide an impartial assessment of the operational environment in Gaza and how a modern armed force might successfully comply with international humanitarian law while at the same time achieving its military objectives.  Indeed, the investigation is so fundamentally flawedboth procedurally and substantivelythat it does nothing to advance the cause of protecting civilians in combat, but rather condones a method of warfare that places civilians and their property at risk.", "title": "Goldstone Reconsidered", "subject": "law"}
