Individuals with functional impairment are expected to choose college majors where they have a comparative advantage relative to non-impaired students. Data from the National Survey of College Graduates show that individuals with functional impairment choose majors based on expected earnings, and anticipated differences in earnings from the non-impaired.", "title": "Functional impairment and the choice of college major", "subject": "law"}
