{"abstract": "Little is known about the characteristics of children and youth presenting at emergency settings in psychiatric crisis, and virtually nothing is known about their outcomes. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical profiles of 238 children presenting at two psychiatric emergency settings and enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of three intensive in-home interventions. A second purpose is to examine child mental health outcomes, based on clinical profile and to suggest the utility of using a clinical-profiles approach.", "title": "Outcomes associated with clinical profiles of children in psychiatric crisis enrolled in intensive, in-home interventions", "subject": "law"}
