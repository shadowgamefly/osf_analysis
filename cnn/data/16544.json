{"abstract": "As the Egyptian government took the country offlinein an effort to squelch public dissentthe U.S. Senate considers a bill that would give the President the same emergency powers to shut off critical Internet infrastructure in the event of a cyber emergency.  This bill, along with others like it, has been introduced in light of recent political rhetoric on cyber war.\n\nThe proponents of cyber war evoke images of large explosions, poison gas clouds, and a high degree of mortality.  In reality, cyber warfare is a misleading metaphor, and has long been confused with crime and espionage.  \"Cyber war\" is not an issue of war, but an issue of security--systems security, network security, and due diligence on part of its operators.  The majority of security breaches today are as a result of systems failure and human error, and the legal responses considered should be limited to such.\n\nThis comment acknowledges that cyber security is relevant to national security, but makes the point that sweeping legislation may have the same effect as the cyber attacks they seek to addressboth may have devastating effects on the economic vitality of the nation.", "title": "Shaping Preventive Policy in Cyber War and Cyber Security: A Pragmatic Approach", "subject": "law"}
