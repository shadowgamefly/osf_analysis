{"abstract": "Using an adapted taxonomy, this article identifies the technological features on predominant social media sites - Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Wikipedia  that encourage and constrain users from engaging in generative activities. Notwithstanding the conflicting narrative painted by recent litigation around copyright in relation to content on social media sites, I observe that some of the main technological features on social media sites are designed around copyright considerations. References are made to the legal positions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. I argue that users of social media sites are subject to the mixed signals given by social media sites, as a result of which they are unfairly exposed to the risks of allegations of copyright infringement. Given the ubiquitous usage of social media sites, the article questions the resulting vulnerability of users who act under the influence of social media sites, and hopes to stimulate further discussion in this area.", "title": "Technological Nudges and Copyright on Social Media Sites", "subject": "law"}
