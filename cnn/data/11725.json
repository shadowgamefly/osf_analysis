{"abstract": "Applying multiple queues, this monograph presents perspectives on how to define and measure self-confidence: geometrical reasoning (fractals, sets, gaskets), biological markers of confidence (oxytocin, growth hormone, serotonin), and stochastic compartmental stimulations of the mood profile and functionality subscales. It compares confidence (that internal tranquil bravado) in respects to the ambitions, motivations, and morality. Benevolent and evil confidence, types of confidence of a reasonable person vs. psychopath constructs, are compared.", "title": "CONFIDENCE: Does it matter?", "subject": "law"}
