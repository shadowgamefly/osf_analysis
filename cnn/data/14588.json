{"abstract": "Gender equity has been a prominent aspect of equity concerns in public policy. The gender dimension has led to widespread advocacy and focused attention on equity in other than economic areas, such as education, health, decision-making, violence against women and political participation. The human development approach offers a capability-based approach to gender equity in development that is a departure from traditions focused on income and growth. Gender concerns have given the approach the power and flexibility to encompass aspects of inequality that would otherwise go unremarked. Its sensitivity to gender in turn has made it sensitive to a range of potential inequities and unfreedoms that can affect all people. The fact that progress in equal rights for women has come about largely through the efforts of social reform movement in the 19th century and womens liberation movement in the 20th century Maharashtra has highlighted the essential role of collective agency in human progress. Moreover, given the constraints on womens agency in almost all societies by political institutions such as male-dominated political parties, social institutions such as the family, and social norms such as womens responsibilities for care work, these issues and their underlying causes clearly must be tackled head on.", "title": "Sex Ratio in Mumbai", "subject": "law"}
