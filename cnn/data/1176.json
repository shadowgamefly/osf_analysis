{"subject": "law", "title": "Singapores Elected President: An Office that is Still Evolving", "abstract": "Constitutional changes effected to Singapores Constitution in 1991 transformed the office of President from a purely ceremonial one chosen by the Parliament, to one directly elected by the people exercising certain discretionary powers. Among other things, the President may now veto attempts by the Government to deplete the nations past financial reserves, and to effect unsuitable appointments to or dismissals of key public officers. Now, the Government is proposing to tweak the system further."}
