{"abstract": "This article relies upon the political and economic analysis of such great thinkers as Aristotle and Rousseau to understand and normatively evaluate constitutional caselaw in general and education cases in particular. The article's title contains its conclusion: a judicially created right to a quality education is a laudable, but possibly counterproductive and definitely insufficient condition, for creating a humane constitutional system. The rest of society needs to do far more to protect the average citizen and worker from the ever-ravenous ruling class. All the edification in the world will not mean much if there are only a few decent jobs available, jobs that promote human dignity, a decent family life, a satisfactory income, and a sustainable economy that does not wreck our biosphere.", "title": "Why a Fundamental Right to a Quality Education Is Not Enough", "subject": "law"}
