{"subject": "law", "title": "On Normative Effects of Immigration Law.pdf", "abstract": "Can laws shape and mold our attitudes, values, and social norms, and if so, how do immigration laws affect our attitudes or views toward minority groups?&nbsp; I explore these questions through a randomized laboratory experiment that examines whether and to what extent short-term exposures to anti-immigration and pro-immigration laws affect peoples implicit and explicit attitudes toward Latinos.&nbsp; My analysis shows that exposure to an anti-immigration law is associated with increased perceptions among study participants that Latinos are unintelligent and law-breaking.&nbsp; In contrast, I find no evidence that exposure to pro-immigration laws promoted positive attitudes toward Latinos.&nbsp; Taken together, these results suggest that exposure to anti-immigration laws can easily trigger negative racial attitudes, but fostering positive racial attitudes through pro-immigration laws might be substantially more difficult.&nbsp; I argue that a fuller appreciation of the impacts of immigration laws requires an understanding of their normative effects.&nbsp; I conclude by discussing the directions for future research on law, racial attitudes, and intergroup relations, and the policy implications of my findings."}
