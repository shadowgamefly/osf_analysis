{"abstract": "All companies are formed by consensus. When the affectio societatis is broken, partners no longer have the intention of proceeding with business activities. There are then two possibilities, when dealing with limited liability companies: liquidation of the company, or termination of the company in relation to a partner, among others. During this period, due to the principle of preservation of the company, it is important to analyze the economic view regarding the possibility of a partners departure from the company and reimbursement for his participation as one of the productive unities of the company which he was part of. The general goal of this article is to analyze types of reimbursement. The specific goals are: (i) to explain the procedure of a cash payment at the time of withdrawal, (ii) which may present as legal action which grants ownership of production unities of the company, and the principle of preservation of the company, and (iii) to present jurisprudence of the State Courts and the Superior Court of Justice regarding the objectives presented herein. The methodology applied to this essay is performed by bibliographic revision and research of secondary information related to the theme, such as decisions of the Courts and the Superior Court of Justice.", "title": "THE PRODUCTIVE UNITIES OF THE COMPANY AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE PARTICIPATION IN JUDICIAL WITHDRAWAL DECISION", "subject": "law"}
