{"abstract": "In these reflections presented at a Symposium hosted by Duquesne University School of Law on \"The Future of the Establishment Clause in Context: Neutrality, Religion, or Avoidance?,\" I examine the constitutional politics driving the interpretation of the Establishment Clause. I suggest that the Supreme Courts recent case law on taxpayer standing may signal a return to the founding design of the Establishment Clause. At the founding, the Establishment Clause constrained the actions of only the national government, disabled only Congress from establishing a religion, and vigorously protected the sovereignty of states. Each of these three signpostsnational interdiction, congressional disability, and state sovereigntymay yet again soon hold true if the Supreme Court continues on what appears to be its current path toward de-incorporating the Establishment Clause.", "title": "The Constitutional Politics of the Establishment Clause", "subject": "law"}
