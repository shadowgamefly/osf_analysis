{"abstract": "This Article focuses on the influence of framing on contract-interpretation decisions. A large body of both psychological and economic studies suggests that people treat payoffs framed as gains and payoffs framed as losses distinctly. Building on these studies, we hypothesize that contract interpretation decisions will be affected by the way in which they are framed. More specifically, we expect that promisors will tend to adopt a more self-serving interpretation when they are making decisions in the domain of losses. To test this prediction, we run a series of three experiments that are all based on a between-subject design. The first two studies utilize experimental surveys that measure and compare participants attitudes toward a contract interpretation dilemma. The third study is an incentive-compatible lab experiment, in which participants actual interpretive decisions determine their payoff. All three experiments confirm our basic hypothesis, and show that framing contractual payoffs as losses rather than gains raises parties tendency to interpret their obligations selfishly. Based on these findings the Article revisits some of the basic questions of contract law, shedding new light on an array of issues such as the law of liquidated damages and the optimal design of contracts.", "title": "Reference Points and Contract Interpretation: An Empirical Examination", "subject": "law"}
