{"abstract": "A six-way division of constitutional text is presented. Responsibilities and disabilities occupy the semantic spaces ordinarily assigned to powers and rights, respectively. Titles, offices and intersections are segregated, which category includes the restraints between any two (and more) actors and bodies.

Finally each instance of an apparatus, permitting, commanding, and prohibiting operational consideration of issues (as they may arise in the future) are named.", "title": "Table Annexed to Article: Our Aesthetic Constitutions: A New View", "subject": "law"}
