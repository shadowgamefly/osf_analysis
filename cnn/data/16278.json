{"abstract": "China, as a country with a history of more than five thousand years, her legal education is non-independent and non-professional but the governments conduct.  Affected by her political and historical situations, Chinese legal education stresses its political function and theoretical teaching but neglect practicing skills and professional responsibilities training.  How to realize the professionalization (not governmentalization) of legal education and how to bridge the gap of theory and practice are the main problems for current legal education in China.  Chinese education administration agencies and legal educators are actively making efforts to reform legal education system, but the great progress has not been made so far.  This article emphasizes the problems of legal education in todays China and gives some modest suggestions for modernizing Chinese legal education from a historical and cultural perspective.", "title": "LEGAL EDUCATION OF TODAYS CHINA:PROBLEMS AND SUGGESTIONS", "subject": "law"}
