{"abstract": "This article addresses the gender bias presented by the disparate treatment of sex and violence under current obscenity jurisprudence. Under the controlling standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Miller v. California, sexual works may readily be regulated as obscenity, while violent works unequivocally may not. This article posits that this disparate treatment is the product of entrenched stereotypes about the way men and women should react to sex and violence, and notes the hypocrisy of failing to apply the same reasoning to assessments of violent versus sexual material.\nFirst, reliance on community standards to define what material is offensive to the point of obscene necessarily incorporates outdated, if still widely accepted, stereotypes regarding what constitutes proper sexual conduct for men versus women. Second, by limiting obscenity to sexual speech, the Supreme Court has codified into constitutional law the idea that sexin particular, female sexualityis too offensive a topic for public discourse. Keeping sex taboo forces juries to rely on these sexual stereotypes because the lack of public discourse precludes basing community standards on actual community practices. Moreover, every development in obscenity law grew out of a social movement to stop the democratization of female sexuality; the article examines how keeping sex taboo has proven an effective means to that end throughout American history. Third, and conversely, by expressly refusing to regulate violent speech, the Supreme Court furthers a normative masculine stereotype that glorifies violence and ignores social harms which uniquely befall women. This article argues that legal codification of harmful stereotypes is a problem that the law should seek to eradicate, not a tradition it seeks to perpetuate. As such, the Supreme Court should abandon Miller posthaste.", "title": "Sex Is Less Offensive Than Violence:  A Call to Update Obscenity Jurisprudence", "subject": "law"}
