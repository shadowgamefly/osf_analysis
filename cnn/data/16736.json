{"abstract": "This book surveys the leading modern theories of property  Lockean, libertarian, utilitarian/law-and-economics, personhood, Kantian, and human flourishing  and then applies those theories to concrete contexts in which property issues have been especially controversial. These include redistribution, the right to exclude, regulatory takings, eminent domain, and intellectual property. The book highlights the Aristotelian human flourishing theory of property, providing the most comprehensive and accessible introduction to that theory to date. The book's goal is neither to cover every conceivable theory nor to discuss every possible facet of the theories covered. Instead, it aims to make the major property theories comprehensible to beginners, without sacrificing accuracy or sophistication. The book will be of particular interest to students seeking an accessible introduction to contemporary theories of property, but even specialists will benefit from the book's lucid descriptions of contemporary debates.\n> Surveys all of the major current liberal legal and political theories of property in an accessible and enjoyable style\n> Provides contextual studies of those theories through concrete areas of major property disputes\n> Introduces a normative theory of property based on the Aristotelian ideal of human flourishing and illustrates how that theory differs from other leading property theories in concrete disputes", "title": "An Introduction to Property Theory", "subject": "law"}
