{"abstract": "Recent school finance litigation illustrates yet again how law can generate unintended policy consequences. Seeking to improve student achievement and school accountability, more states now turn to educational  standards and assessments. At the same time, a multi-decade school  finance litigation effort develops and changes its theoretical base.  Recently, educational  standards and school finance litigation converged in a way that enables  school districts to gain financially from their inability to meet  desired achievement levels. Specifically, courts increasingly allow  litigants and lawsuits to transform standards and assessments into  constitutional entitlements to additional resources. As a consequence,  increased legal and financial exposure for school districts follows from  the implementation of what many consider a plausible educational  policy. The judiciary's participation in this transformation uncovers  old and new problems that arise when courts are asked to set educational policy.", "title": "The Courts, Educational Policy, and Unintended Consequences", "subject": "law"}
