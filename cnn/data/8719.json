{"abstract": "This chapter explores the recent upsurge of piracy off the coast of East Africa. It begins by exploring the definition of piracy, particularly with regard to certain difficulties faced with applying the traditional conception of piracy under international law to the situation off the coast of East Africa. It will then examine whether there is a distinction between the piracy situation in East Africa and that in other regions, in particularly Southeast Asia and West Africa. Further, the chapter will examine the various approaches to dealing with piracy in East Africa with a view to determining how effective they are in curbing piracy incidents in this region.", "title": "Piracy and the East African Region", "subject": "law"}
