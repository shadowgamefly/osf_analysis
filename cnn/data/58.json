{"subject": "law", "abstract": "The paper aims to examine the changes in the rural waste management sector at regional scale since theRomania adhesion to the EU in 2007. The traditional waste management based on the mixed waste collection and waste disposal often on improper sites prevailed in municipal waste management options of transitional economies across the globe. The lack of formal waste collection services in rural areas has encouraged the open dumping or backyard burning. The paper analyzes the improvements and challenges oflocal authorities to fulfill the new EU requirements in this sector supported by data analysis at local administrative unit levels and field observations. Geographical analysis is compulsory to reveal the local disparities. The paper performs an assessment of waste collection issues across 78rural municipalities within Neamt County. This sector is emerging in rural areas of Eastern Europe, but is far from an efficient municipal waste management system based on the waste hierarchy concept.", "title": "Waste collection in rural communities: challenges under EU regulations.
