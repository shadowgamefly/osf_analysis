{"abstract": "Corporations enjoy virtually unlimited First Amendment protections under the current law. Corporate personhood and the constitutional rights of corporations have become polarizing and controversial topics, especially in the wake of the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling.  However, this area of law has been gradually developing well before that case was ever argued.\nA review of the Citizens United line of cases explains how the law has evolved to this point. Furthermore, exploration of organizational concepts of corporations and other business entities illustrates significant differences between them and natural persons. These inherent traits of corporations make their speech primarily transactional in nature, and make them poorly suited to engage in political speech. Despite the ruling in the Citizens United case, the very nature of a corporation makes it both prudent and constitutionally permissible to apply regulations and restrictions to corporate political speech more strictly than they are applied to natural persons.", "title": "The Corporation and Transactional Political Speech", "subject": "law"}
