{"subject": "law", "title": "Rethinking Custodial Interrogation", "abstract": "This Article attempts to resurrect a concept crucial to the Supreme Court lexicon. It is not, however, a police manual. This Article concerns itself solely with questions surrounding the admissibility of confessions, and in so doing, attempts to show that only a reconsideration of custodial interrogation can restore the \"significant deprivations\" language to the status granted it in Miranda v. Arizona."}
