{"abstract": "What is the connection between constitutional traditions and competition law regimes? This article compares the constitutional traditions of the US and Latin America to show how some of their most salient aspects influenced the development of their respective competition law regimes between the 1910s and the 1990s. In particular, it shows how constitutional doctrines regarding property rights and freedom of contract, and the role of governmental intervention in achieving development contributed to shaping the merits of different competition law regimes. The differences in how the US and Latin American traditions perceive the role of the State vis-a-vis property rights and competition, are useful for understanding particular aspects of competition law regimes. Hence, a comparative approach to the relations between constitutional traditions and competition law regimes can be useful to unveil key underlying ideas about competition law regimes and their particular institutions.", "title": "Constitutional Traditions and Competition Law Regimes: A Primer", "subject": "law"}
