{"abstract": "Iran has a long history of social movements and revolutions. The 1906 Constitutional Revolution led to the recognition of individual rights as part of Irans first Constitution. With the Islamic Revolution of 1979, a new constitution was enacted, which devoted one chapter to the Rights of the Nation.\nThe Constitution has introduced several methods to protect the recognized rights: the Guardian Council, the Tribunal of Administrative Justice, and the Commission of Article 90.\nIn addition to the institutions introduced in the Constitution, the Legislature and the Executive branch proposed new safeguarding procedures and adopted new statutes, which recognized broader range of rights. A brief review of the individual rights in the past thirty years in Iran shows that the Executive Branch and the Legislature have taken many attempts for promulgation of individual rights. Yet, their efficiency remains in question.\nThis paper addresses the concern of the implementation of individual rights in Iran. It will discuss the current recognized rights with a historical review and study the procedures that safeguard the existing rights in Iran.\nAlthough many rights have been recognized and methods of have been introduced to ensure their implementation, the concern of individual rights still exists. The current methods each partially address the needs of the citizens to demand their rights. Studying the current methods in Iran indicates the absence of one objective and independent body that would be cognizable to hear all cases of constitutional violations", "title": "Demanding Individual Rights and Civil Liberties: An Iranian Approach", "subject": "law"}
