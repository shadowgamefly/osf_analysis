{"abstract": "Before 35 U.S.C.  299 was enacted, some minority district courts had permitted joinder of independent defendants only because the same patent was infringed. That gave a great incentive to non-practicing entities to sue as many defendants as possible in one suit. To resolve this problem, Congress created  299(b) to abrogate the minority view of joinder. The Federal Circuit in In re EMC Corp. also created a test requiring finding of an actual link between the facts underlying each claim of infringement. The Federal Circuit provides six EMC factors for lower courts to determine permissive joinder. However, the Eastern District of Texas relies primarily on the use of identically sourced parts to find joiner, while other district courts have denied joinder of direct competitors. Particularly, in mobile phone technology cases, the Eastern District of Texas has permitted joinder only because the same hardware component is used, while other courts may find misjoinder only because mobile devices of one manufacturers operational system are not the same as mobile devices of another manufacturers operational system. To resolve the inconsistency, this article offers a certain connection approach in light of Congress intent and EMC. The approach focuses on something connecting the infringement claims against independent defendants.", "title": "Problematic Approaches of the Joinder Clause under the America Invents Act by Federal District Courts", "subject": "law"}
