{"abstract": "The decision by the New York Court of Appeals in Brady v. The Williams Capital Group, L.P., 2010 WL 1068163 (N.Y. Mar. 25, 2010) should cause us to note that some employer mandated arbitration agreements not only take away an employees right to sue the employer in court, but as well, impose arbitration costs\\expenses on the employee.  The employee who lacks funds is unable to make use of the arbitration process. \tAn arbitration provision is not rendered inherently unconscionable because some of the arbitration costs will be imposed on the claimant. See Zobrist v. Verizon Wireless, 354 Ill. App. 3d 1139, 1146, 822 N.E.2d 531, 539-40, 290 Ill. Dec. 946 (2004) (citing Green Tree Financial Corp.-Alabama, 531 U.S. at 91-92, 148 L. Ed. 2d at 384, 121 S. Ct. at 522-23).  However, individualized circumstances may show that an employee should not be burdened with arbitration costs and expenses.", "title": "CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS & UNAFFORDABLE ARBITRATION:  LACK OF EMPLOYEE ACCESS TO ARBITRATION", "subject": "law"}
