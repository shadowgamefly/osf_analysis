{"abstract": "This paper explores the resistance in U.S. copyright law to extend copyright protection to scents and tastes, and advances the position that copyright laws originality and expression requirements limit copyrightable subject matter to expressions that engage both author and audience in a way that requires reflection upon the workor at least, the capacity for reflectionin a necessarily intersubjective and communicative fashion, what I call a public dimension.  That the sensations of taste and smell are inescapably immediate and private suggest that they lack the kind of public dimension that visual and audio works exhibit.  Indeed, this creates an ineffability characterized by a lack of the sort of originality and expressiveness that underlie copyright protection under both the moral rights and progress of the arts and sciences rationales, though more so for the second rationale, i.e., the basis for U.S. copyright law.  The latter disconnect is particularly suggestive: because taste and scents desired, artistic effects are ineluctably connected with private interests of pleasure, works of taste and scent cannot escape the utilitarian function that limits copyright protection in the United States.  As I shall argue below, the reason why this utilitarian function does not also subsume the pleasures one gets from visual and audio works of art is because the latter engage and arrest our capacity for reflection in a necessarily communicable way, at least in the sense that they make a public claim for an explanation even if none is forthcoming.", "title": "WHY COPYRIGHT LAW LACKS  TASTE AND SCENTS", "subject": "law"}
