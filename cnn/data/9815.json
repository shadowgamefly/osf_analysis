{"abstract": "The object of this paper is, on one hand, to rethink the freedom of expression in the Digital Age as a ius communicationis: a right to communicate which includes the whole communicative process, both active and passive dimension and the rights to spread, seek, receive and access information; and, on the other hand, It would translate the guarantees of freedom of expression (in particular prohibition of  a previous censorship) to the new means of control (both private and public ones) in Internet.\n\nSOMMARIO: 1.- Digital society and the Internet impact on freedom of speech. 2.- The prohibition of censorship as guarantee of freedom of speech in the Digital Age. 3.- Projection of the guarantees to freedom of speech on the new forms of censorship. 3.1.- The authorizations for access to the Internet as forms of prior restraints. 3.2.- Illegal content and legitimacy of concrete blocking to Internet information and closure of websites. 3.3.- The illegitimacy of public imposition of general Internet filtering and blocking systems. Principles for adequate public regulation of filtering systems in protection from harmful content. 3.4.- Risks of pluralism in the web: the business domain and private censorship. 4. To conclude: constitutional guarantees to freedom of speech and the need to protect pluralism in the Network.", "title": "Looking for the redefinition of freedom of speech in the Digital Age", "subject": "law"}
