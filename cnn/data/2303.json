{"abstract": "Analyses of the viability of biofuels as alternatives to fossil fuels haveoften adopted a technocratic approach that focuses on environmentalconsequences, but places less emphasis on the impact that biofuels may haveon vulnerable populations. This Article fills the gap in the existing literatureby evaluating biofuels through the lens of environmental justice  includingclimate justice and food justice. The Article examines the impact of biofuelson the global food system and on the planets most food-insecurepopulations. It concludes that the laws and policies promoting thecultivation of biofuels have contributed to global malnourishment by raisingfood prices and accelerating the large-scale acquisition of arable lands inpoor countries that deprive local communities of the land and waternecessary to grow food (a phenomenon known as land-grabbing).Ironically, the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of many biofuels exceedthose of the fossil fuels they replace. Instead of mitigating climate change,the promotion of biofuels threatens to intensify an industrial model ofagricultural production that degrades local ecosystems, exacerbates climatechange, and intensifies food insecurity. The Article concludes by discussinggovernance strategies to foster a more equitable and sustainable approachto bioenergy that respects, protects, and fulfills the human right to food.", "title": "The Environmental Justice Implications of Biofuels", "subject": "law"}
