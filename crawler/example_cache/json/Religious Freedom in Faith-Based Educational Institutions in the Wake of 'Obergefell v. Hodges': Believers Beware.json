{"subject": "law", "title": "Religious Freedom in Faith-Based Educational Institutions in the Wake of 'Obergefell v. Hodges': Believers Beware", "abstract": "Solicitor General Donald Verrilli\u2019s fateful words, uttered in response to a question posed by Justice Samuel Alito during oral arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges,2 likely sent chills up the spines of leaders in faith-based educational institutions, from pre-schools to universities. In Obergefell, a bare majority of the Supreme Court legalized same-sex unions in the United States. Verrilli\u2019s words, combined with the outcome in Obergefell, have a potentially chilling effect on religious freedom. The decision does not only impact educational institutions\u2014the primary focus of this article\u2014but also a wide array of houses of worship. Other religiously affiliated institutions that may be affected include health and social services agencies, such as those working with adoptions 3 and ministering to the needy.4 These educational institutions and other agencies designed to assist the common good run the risk of being shuttered as a form of punishment, to the detriment of many, if they remain true to their faith\u2014a decidedly un- American prospect."}
