{"subject": "law", "title": "Handbook of Comparative Higher Education Law", "abstract": "The Handbook of Comparative Higher Education Law addresses legal issues from institutions of higher learning in seventeen countries on all six inhabited continents in a reader friendly manner. All chapters follow the same outline on institutional issues, faculty rights, student rights, and emerging issues so that similarities and differences can be compared. An introductory chapter provides an overview on the legal status of higher education as selected in various international covenants. In addition, a concluding chapter draws the themes addressed throughout the book together and centers on the concept of best practice management. This book serves as valuable resource for educational practitioners in higher education insofar as it provides them with an enhanced awareness of strategies that are being used to manage problems commonly faced in multiple educational settings."}
